The objective of the company is to decide which demands to be fufilled over a ﬁnite sales horizon [0,10] to maximize the total expected revenue from ﬁxed initial inventories. The on-hand inventories for the three items are c_1,c_2,c_3 respectively. During the sales horizon, replenishment is not allowed and there is no any in-transit inventories. Customers who want to purchase P1,P2,P3 arrive at each period accoring to a Poisson process with a_1,a_2,a_3 the arrival rates respectively. Decision variables y_1,y_2,y_3 correspond to the number of requests that the firm plans to fulfill for product 1,2,3. These variables are all positive integers.\n",

The decision variables x_11, x_12, x_13, x_21, x_22, x_23, x_31, x_32, and x_33 represent the quantities of fashion products supplied from Center A, Center B, and Center C to Stores X, Y, and Z, respectively.fixed costs for the centers: f_1 = 48, f_2 = 55, f_3 = 86; \\ntransportation costs per unit of electronics: c_11 = 22, c_12 = 21, c_13 = 19; c_21 = 11, c_22 = 12, c_23 = 14,c_31 = 9, c_32 = 10, c_33 = 11; \\ncapacity of the centers: k_1 = 650, k_2 = 800, k_3 = 580.\\nData_address: \\nLabel: min 48y_1 + 55y_2 + 86y_3 + 22x_11 + 21x_12 + 19x_13 + 11x_21 + 12x_22 + 14x_23 + 9x_31 + 10x_32 + 11x_33\\nsubject to \\n    x_11 + x_12 + x_13 = 1\\n    x_21 + x_22 + x_23 = 1\\n    x_31 + x_32 + x_33 = 1\\n    -y_1 + x_11 <= 0\\n    -y_1 + x_21 <= 0\\n    -y_1 + x_31 <= 0\\n    -y_2 + x_12 <= 0\\n    -y_2 + x_22 <= 0\\n    -y_2 + x_32 <= 0\\n    -y_3 + x_13 <= 0\\n    -y_3 + x_23 <= 0\\n    -y_3 + x_33 <= 0\\n    y_1 + y_3 + y_3 <= 650\\n    x_11 + x_22 + x_32 <= 800\\n    x_13 + x_23 + x_33 <= 580 \\n    y_1, y_2, y_3 ∈ {{0,1}}}}\\n    x_11, x_12, x_13, x_21, x_22, x_23, x_31, x_32, x_33 ∈ R+\\nRelated: \\nProblem Type: Others without CSV - Capacitated Facility Location Problem')]}\u001b[0m\n",

Each distribution center incurs a fixed cost, denoted by f_1 , f_2 , and f_3 , when operational. Store X has transportation costs per unit of fashion products from Center A, Center B, and Center C, denoted as t_11, t_12 , and t_13 , respectively. Similarly, Store Y and Store Z have transportation costs per unit from Center A, Center B, and Center C, denoted as t_21, t_22 , t_23 and t_31 , t_32, t_33, respectively.The objective is to determine which distribution centers should be operational (open) and how much fashion products should be supplied from each center to each store to meet the demand while minimizing the total cost, considering the capacity constraints. The decision variables y_1 , y_2 , and y_3 are binary variables indicating whether Center A, Center B, and Center C are operational (open). The decision variables x_11, x_12, x_13, x_21, x_22, x_23, x_31, x_32, and x_33 represent the quantities of fashion products supplied from Center A, Center B, and Center C to Stores X, Y, and Z, respectively.fixed costs for the centers: f_1 = 48, f_2 = 55, f_3 = 86; \\ntransportation costs per unit of electronics: c_11 = 22, c_12 = 21, c_13 = 19; c_21 = 11, c_22 = 12, c_23 = 14,c_31 = 9, c_32 = 10, c_33 = 11; \\ncapacity of the centers: k_1 = 650, k_2 = 800, k_3 = 580.\\nData_address: \\nLabel: min 48y_1 + 55y_2 + 86y_3 + 22x_11 + 21x_12 + 19x_13 + 11x_21 + 12x_22 + 14x_23 + 9x_31 + 10x_32 + 11x_33\\nsubject to \\n    x_11 + x_12 + x_13 = 1\\n    x_21 + x_22 + x_23 = 1\\n    x_31 + x_32 + x_33 = 1\\n    -y_1 + x_11 <= 0\\n    -y_1 + x_21 <= 0\\n    -y_1 + x_31 <= 0\\n    -y_2 + x_12 <= 0\\n    -y_2 + x_22 <= 0\\n    -y_2 + x_32 <= 0\\n    -y_3 + x_13 <= 0\\n    -y_3 + x_23 <= 0\\n    -y_3 + x_33 <= 0\\n    y_1 + y_3 + y_3 <= 650\\n    x_11 + x_22 + x_32 <= 800\\n    x_13 + x_23 + x_33 <= 580 \\n    y_1, y_2, y_3 ∈ {{0,1}}}}\\n    x_11, x_12, x_13, x_21, x_22, x_23, x_31, x_32, x_33 ∈ R+\\nRelated: \\nProblem Type: Others without CSV - Capacitated Facility Location Problem')]}\u001b[0m\n",
