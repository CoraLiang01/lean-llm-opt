Text:There are three best-selling items (P1, P2, P3) on Amazon with the profit w_1,w_2,w_3.There is an independent demand stream for each of the products. The objective of the company is to decide which demands to be fufilled over a ﬁnite sales horizon [0,10] to maximize the total expected revenue from ﬁxed initial inventories. The on-hand inventories for the three items are c_1,c_2,c_3 respectively. During the sales horizon, replenishment is not allowed and there is no any in-transit inventories. Customers who want to purchase P1,P2,P3 arrive at each period accoring to a Poisson process with a_1,a_2,a_3 the arrival rates respectively. Decision variables y_1,y_2,y_3 correspond to the number of requests that the firm plans to fulfill for product 1,2,3. These variables are all positive integers.\n",

I also know the capacity consumption for each ticket type: Eco_flex (f) = 2.1 units, Eco_lite (l) = 1 unit. Now, I will define the SBLP model, including all required parameters, and then provide the Gurobi Python code.\n",

The company has 100 units of raw materials and 90 units of labor available for production each day. Due to market demand, the minimum daily production quantities for product A and product B are 20 units and 15 units, respectively. The profit per unit for product A is 5 units, and the profit per unit for product B is 6 units. The company's goal is to maximize the total profit per day.

      "\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mQuestion: Based on flight ticket options provided in the table, along with their average passengers (Avg Pax), average prices (Avg Price), and capacity coefficients (Flex Cpy Coef), considering that each Eco_flex ticket consumes 2.4 units of flight capacity and each Eco_lite ticket consumes 1 unit of capacity, while enforcing flow conservation constraints at each airport for long-term planning model, develop a Sales-Based Linear Programming (SBLP) model. The goal of this model is to recommend the optimal 8 flights that maximize total ticket sale revenue, specifically among flights where the origin-destination pairs are: OD = ('A', 'B') or OD = ('A', 'C') or OD = ('B', 'A') or ('C', 'A') in a departure period (09:00-19:00) in which the optional flights are: (OD = ('A', 'B') AND Departure Time='11:20'), (OD = ('A', 'B') AND Departure Time='17:05'), (OD = ('A', 'C') AND Departure Time='17:25'), (OD = ('A', 'C') AND Departure Time='09:45'), (OD = ('B', 'A') AND Departure Time='15:40'), (OD = ('B', 'A') AND Departure Time='18:50'), (OD = ('B', 'A') AND Departure Time='09:05'), (OD = ('C', 'A') AND Departure Time='16:55'), (OD = ('C', 'A') AND Departure Time='18:30').\n",
