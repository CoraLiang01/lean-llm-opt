### LLM for Large-Scale Optimization Model Auto-Formulation: A Lightweight Few-Shot Learning Approach

#### Overview
LEAN-LLM-OPT is an innovative framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for the automatic formulation of large-scale optimization models. This repository contains the implementation of the framework, benchmark datasets, and experimental results, along with case studies, including its application to Singapore Airlines Choice-Based Revenue Management.
