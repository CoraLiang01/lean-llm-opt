"The planning of the operation and use of arrival and departure lines at large passenger railway stations in our country is mainly carried out by dispatchers, and the adjustment of the operation plan is not flexible. In the case of a fixed scale of arrival and departure lines at the station, optimizing and improving the technical operations of trains can help improve the throughput capacity of railway stations. In order to adapt to the characteristics of railway operation and improve the efficiency of station technical operations, the feasibility and real-time performance of adjusting and optimizing station operation plans need to be continuously improved. The allocation and use of approach tracks and arrival and departure lines in the throat area of the station are key links in the preparation and adjustment of operation plans, which need to be continuously studied to meet the needs of on-site operations. The arrival and departure line of a railway refers to the route where trains stop at the station, pick up and drop off passengers, and perform dispatch operations. The arrival and departure line is usually a line or multiple lines parallel or connected to the main line, used for train entry and exit, as well as train stopping and dispatching. The allocation and preparation of arrival and departure lines for railway trains refers to the reasonable arrangement of the operation plan and stopping tracks of railway trains on different arrival and departure lines based on the needs of train operation and the conditions of arrival and departure lines.

### Question Description

There are multiple optimization objectives for the allocation of railway train arrival and departure lines, such as:
- Minimizing the dwell time of trains, reducing the waiting time for trains to park, and improving the efficiency of train operation;
- Maximizing the speed of trains, reducing the travel time of trains, and improving the efficiency of train operation;
- Maximizing the throughput capacity of the station, allowing the station to accommodate and dispatch more trains at the same time, and meet the travel needs of more passengers;
- Minimizing the delay rate of trains, reducing train delays, and improving the punctuality and reliability of trains;
- Maximizing passenger satisfaction and providing a convenient travel experience for passengers;
- Other optimization objectives.

Please model the medium-term arrangement of approach tracks in the train station based on the job shop model. Use the COPT (Cardinal Optimizer) solver to solve this problem. Output the train timetable for each train, as well as the arrival and departure timetable for each station.

### Data Introduction

We assume that a total of 16 trains are operated, and model the approach tracks and track selection in Station A. A track refers to a lane in the station where trains can stop. Each station has a certain number of tracks depending on its size, used to park different trains. The station boundary refers to the boundary of the station area, which is the dividing point between entering and leaving the station. An approach track refers to the path a train takes when entering the station and reaching a track. Generally, there are multiple approach tracks connecting different tracks in the station. Trains choose different approach tracks before entering the station, and then stop on the corresponding tracks.

### Train Data
We consider 16 trains on the line, each with different speeds and stopping information. Each column in the table represents: train number, train speed, train stop status. ""1"" indicates that the train stops at the station, ""0"" indicates that the train does not stop at the station.

### Station Data

There are 5 tracks in Station A, among which tracks I, II, and III take 4 minutes to reach the station boundary, and tracks IV and V take 5 minutes to reach the station boundary. The time to the station boundary refers to the time it takes for a train to start from a track and pass through the station boundary, including the entire process.

|track|time to boundary (min)|
|:---:|:---:|
|I|4|
|II|4|
|III|4|
|IV|5|
|V|5|

The optional approach tracks and conflict relationships within Station A are as follows. Approach track conflict refers to the occurrence of collisions or operational impacts if two trains choose the same or intersecting approach tracks. To avoid conflicts, at any time, each approach track or any pair of intersecting approach tracks should only allow one train to use them.
|path|from|conflict|
|:---:|:---:|:---|
|1|I|2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7|
|2|I|1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7|
|3|II|1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7|
|4|III|1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7|

|6|IV|1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7|
|7|V|1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6|

Here we assume that the approach tracks conflict with each other pairwise, and at a more detailed level of approach track arrangement, approach tracks to the same boundary may not conflict.

### Other Data
- Since Station A is the starting station, the minimum dwell time is 20 minutes.
- The safe interval between any two trains is 3 minutes.",16,Hard,MIP

"The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) was first proposed by Dantzig in 1959 (Dantzig and Ramser 1959). It is a very classic combinatorial optimization problem. The basic VRP can usually be described as follows: in a certain area, there are a certain number of customers and a distribution center or warehouse. The customers are generally distributed in different locations, and each customer has a certain amount of goods delivery demand. The distribution center or warehouse needs to dispatch a fleet of vehicles and design a suitable delivery plan to fulfill all customer's goods delivery demands. The objective of VRP is to maximize efficiency while meeting all customer demands. The measurement of efficiency is usually presented in the form of an objective function. The objective function varies with the company's requirements, and common objective functions include minimizing the total distance traveled by vehicles, minimizing the total delivery time, and minimizing the number of vehicles used, etc. In addition to meeting customer delivery demands, VRP generally needs to consider various other constraints, resulting in various variants. For example, if the vehicle's load cannot exceed its maximum capacity (capacity constraint), the problem becomes the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). If the delivery demand of each customer must be delivered within a specific time window, the problem becomes the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW).

The Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) is a classic problem developed from VRP. There are many applications of VRPTW in reality, and each customer point generally has a service time window. For example, some logistics centers need to deliver packages during low-traffic hours, some large supermarkets need to restock during non-business hours, and real-time delivery methods such as food delivery require specific delivery time windows. Time windows can be classified as hard time windows and soft time windows. Hard Time Windows (HTW) means that vehicles must arrive at or before the time window, and cannot delay their arrival. If they arrive early, they must wait until the time window starts to provide service, such as restocking supermarkets and delivering goods from logistics centers, etc. Soft Time Windows (STW) means that vehicles are not required to arrive within the original hard time window, but they should try to arrive within the hard time window. If the vehicle arrives early, a penalty value will be deducted, and if it arrives late, a certain penalty value will be imposed, such as food delivery, school bus pick-up and drop-off, industrial distribution, etc.

The Vehicle Routing Problem with Hard Time Windows (VRPHTW) can be described as follows: there are a certain number of customer points and a distribution center in the region. Vehicles need to depart from the distribution center and return to the distribution center. The route should be continuous, and each customer should be served by one and only one vehicle. The vehicles also have a capacity. Each customer has a specific service time window and can only be served within the time window. Vehicles can arrive at the customer point ahead of time and wait for the time window to open, then provide service to the customer. They can also arrive at the customer point within the time window to provide service. Vehicles can only start serving customers within the time window, and the service time is known. The distribution center needs to arrange a reasonable delivery plan to both complete the delivery tasks and minimize travel costs. VRPHTW, like VRP, mainly emphasizes the travel costs on the routes because delays are not allowed. Now, please model the VRPHTW in operations research.

"As one of the main arteries of urban transportation, the city subway carries a huge passenger flow and its operation and management are very complex. Among them, crew scheduling is one of the key links in subway operation management and also the starting point and difficulty of crew management. The subway transportation volume is large, with complex and changing routes, and frequent operation intervals. Crew drivers face huge, continuous, and high-intensity transportation tasks. It is important to arrange the driver's shift and duty mode reasonably and achieve the optimal allocation of personnel to ensure the efficient and stable operation of the subway. Due to the increasing complexity of the subway operation network, traditional manual scheduling methods can no longer meet the high standard operation requirements. Automated and intelligent crew scheduling has become an inevitable trend.

The general process of crew scheduling for subway operating companies is as follows: export train operation section and time information tables based on the current operation chart, manually divide the crew duty roster based on these information tables, compile the crew scheduling master table based on the duty roster, and finally allocate the crew groups based on the scheduling master table to form the final scheduling table. The entire process relies on manual compilation and mainly has the following three major problems:

1. Low scheduling efficiency: Crew scheduling business rules are complex, and the workload is large. The efficiency of manual compilation is very low, requiring at least one week. The manpower and time costs are high.

2. Difficulty in adjustment: When encountering unexpected situations such as train failures and temporary leave of crew members, it is difficult to quickly adjust the scheduling plan based on manual methods, affecting the efficiency of operation management.

3. Uneven task assignment: Manual scheduling has subjective limitations and strong dependence on human experience. If the scheduling is unreasonable, it may lead to uneven task assignment, unfair scheduling, and low crew satisfaction.

This subway line includes 40 platforms, among which A, M, and Z platforms are available for driver transfers and handovers. Please consider 200 driving tasks and their attributes such as time, location, and mileage, and consider classic constraints in crew scheduling scenarios, such as maximum continuous driving time constraint, mileage limit constraint, attendance location constraint, etc. Compare different mixed integer modeling methods to minimize the number of drivers as the goal and output the optimal task chain combination (i.e. the allocation and connection relationship of all tasks) for all tasks.
