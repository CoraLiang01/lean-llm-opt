"Based on all flight ticket choices in 'flight.csv' and 'od_demand.csv' with attraction values in v1 and shadow attraction value ratios in v2, develop the SBLP(sales-based linear programming) formulation for among flights (OD = ('A', 'C') AND Departure Time='23:00'), (OD = ('A', 'C') AND Departure Time='19:05'), (OD = ('B', 'A') AND Departure Time='15:40'), (OD = ('B', 'A') AND Departure Time='18:50'), (OD = ('C', 'A') AND Departure Time='16:55'), (OD = ('B', 'A') AND Departure Time='09:05'), (OD = ('C', 'A') AND Departure Time='07:40'),  that maximize the total revenue of flight ticket sales. The SBLP should include decision variables, objective function, balance constraints, scale constraints, nonnegative constraints and selection constraints.
