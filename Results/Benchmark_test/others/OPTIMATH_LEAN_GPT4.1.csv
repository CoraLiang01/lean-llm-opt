0,"The manufacturing facility produces custom components for two jobs, Job 0 and Job 1, each consisting of a sequence of operations that must be performed in a specific order. The goal is to schedule these operations to minimize the total completion time (makespan) while satisfying all operational constraints. Job 0 has five operations with processing times: Operation 0 takes 4 units, Operation 1 takes 1 unit, Operation 2 takes 6 units, Operation 3 takes 6 units, and Operation 4 takes 8 units. Job 1 has four operations with processing times: Operation 0 takes 9 units, Operation 1 takes 1 unit, Operation 2 takes 4 units, and Operation 3 takes 2 units.

Precedence constraints ensure that operations within each job are performed in sequence with specific gaps. For Job 0, Operation 1 must start at least 4 units after Operation 0 starts, Operation 2 must start at least 1 unit after Operation 1 starts, Operation 3 must start at least 6 units after Operation 2 starts, and Operation 4 must start at least 6 units after Operation 3 starts. For Job 1, Operation 1 must start at least 9 units after Operation 0 starts, Operation 2 must start at least 1 unit after Operation 1 starts, and Operation 3 must start at least 4 units after Operation 2 starts.

Machine capacity constraints ensure that operations assigned to the same machine do not overlap. Binary variables determine the order of operations on shared machines. For example, if Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 3 of Job 0 are on the same machine, one must complete at least 6 units before the other starts. Similarly, if Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 2 of Job 1 are on the same machine, one must complete at least 4 units before the other starts. These constraints apply to all operation pairs on shared machines, ensuring no overlap and maintaining required time gaps. The large constant of 100,000 is used in these constraints to enforce the sequencing logic by ensuring that the constraints are only active when the binary variable is set to 1.

The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. Specifically, the makespan must be at least 4 units after Operation 0 of Job 0 starts, 1 unit after Operation 1 of Job 0 starts, 6 units after Operation 2 of Job 0 starts, 6 units after Operation 3 of Job 0 starts, 8 units after Operation 4 of Job 0 starts, 9 units after Operation 0 of Job 1 starts, 1 unit after Operation 1 of Job 1 starts, 4 units after Operation 2 of Job 1 starts, and 2 units after Operation 3 of Job 1 starts.

The objective is to determine the start times for all operations and the sequence of operations on shared machines to minimize the makespan while respecting all precedence constraints, machine capacity constraints, and the makespan definition. Binary variables are used to enforce the correct sequencing of operations on shared machines, with a large constant of 100,000 ensuring the constraints are properly applied. The start times for all operations and the makespan must be non-negative. The binary variables are explicitly defined for all relevant operation pairs on shared machines, and the start times and makespan are continuous variables.","\[

1,"The problem involves scheduling the landing times of three aircraft to minimize the total penalty costs associated with deviations from their earliest and latest possible landing times while ensuring safe separation between aircraft and adhering to their respective time windows. Each aircraft has an earliest and latest possible landing time, and penalty costs for landing early or late. Aircraft 0 has an earliest landing time of 201 minutes, a latest landing time of 261 minutes, an early penalty cost of \$37 per minute, and a late penalty cost of \$73 per minute. Aircraft 1 has an earliest landing time of 234 minutes, a latest landing time of 294 minutes, an early penalty cost of \$99 per minute, and a late penalty cost of \$84 per minute. Aircraft 2 has an earliest landing time of 29 minutes, a latest landing time of 89 minutes, an early penalty cost of \$90 per minute, and a late penalty cost of \$56 per minute.

The separation requirements are enforced using binary decision variables that determine the order in which the aircraft land. If Aircraft 0 lands before Aircraft 1, there must be at least 11 minutes of separation; if Aircraft 1 lands before Aircraft 0, the separation must be at least 27 minutes. If Aircraft 0 lands before Aircraft 2, there must be at least 9 minutes of separation; if Aircraft 2 lands before Aircraft 0, the separation must be at least 232 minutes. If Aircraft 1 lands before Aircraft 2, there must be at least 9 minutes of separation; if Aircraft 2 lands before Aircraft 1, the separation must be at least 265 minutes.

The landing time windows must be respected: Aircraft 0 must land between 201 and 261 minutes, Aircraft 1 between 234 and 294 minutes, and Aircraft 2 between 29 and 89 minutes. The penalties for early and late landings are calculated based on the difference between the actual landing time and the earliest or latest possible landing time, multiplied by the respective penalty costs. The objective is to determine the optimal landing times for all three aircraft to minimize the total penalty costs while ensuring all separation and time window constraints are satisfied. The total penalty cost is the sum of the early and late penalties for all aircraft. The order in which the aircraft land affects the separation requirements and landing times, so the schedule must balance these costs to achieve the lowest total penalty. Binary decision variables are used to determine the order of aircraft landings, ensuring that the separation constraints are enforced correctly. The constraints also ensure that the landing times are within the specified windows and that the penalties for early and late landings are calculated accurately based on the deviations from the earliest and latest possible landing times.","\[

2,"A logistics company must deliver packages to four cities: City 0, City 1, City 2, and City 3, minimizing the total delivery cost while ensuring each city is visited exactly once and the route forms a continuous loop without subtours.

The position variable for City 0 is fixed at 0, while the position variables for City 1, City 2, and City 3 must be integers between 0 and 3. The objective is to minimize the total delivery cost, which is the sum of the costs of all selected routes, including the term 0 times the position variable for City 0. Constraints ensure each city is visited and departed exactly once. Subtour elimination is enforced by ensuring that if a route from City i to City j is used, the position of City j must be greater than the position of City i, except for City 0, which is fixed as the starting point. These constraints are implemented through specific relationships between the route variables and the position variables, guaranteeing the delivery route forms a single loop without smaller loops. The constraints also explicitly bound the position variables for City 1, City 2, and City 3 to be between 0 and 3, and ensure that the position variables are correctly related to the route variables to eliminate subtours.","\[

m.optimize()",1204,,"A logistics company must deliver packages to four cities: City 0, City 1, City 2, and City 3, minimizing the total delivery cost while ensuring each city is visited exactly once and the route forms a continuous loop without subtours. The delivery costs between cities are as follows: City 0 to City 1 costs 616 units, City 0 to City 2 costs 567 units, City 0 to City 3 costs 143 units, City 1 to City 0 costs 388 units, City 1 to City 2 costs 947 units, City 1 to City 3 costs 628 units, City 2 to City 0 costs 495 units, City 2 to City 1 costs 650 units, City 2 to City 3 costs 604 units, City 3 to City 0 costs 77 units, City 3 to City 1 costs 630 units, and City 3 to City 2 costs 23 units. The company uses binary decision variables to indicate whether a route is used and assigns position variables to each city to prevent subtours. The position variable for City 0 is fixed at 0, while the position variables for City 1, City 2, and City 3 must be integers between 0 and 3. The objective is to minimize the total delivery cost, which is the sum of the costs of all selected routes, including the term 0 times the position variable for City 0. Constraints ensure each city is visited and departed exactly once. Subtour elimination is enforced by ensuring that if a route from City i to City j is used, the position of City j must be greater than the position of City i, except for City 0, which is fixed as the starting point. These constraints are implemented through specific relationships between the route variables and the position variables, guaranteeing the delivery route forms a single loop without smaller loops. The constraints also explicitly bound the position variables for City 1, City 2, and City 3 to be between 0 and 3, and ensure that the position variables are correctly related to the route variables to eliminate subtours.",1204,1
3,"The problem involves scheduling operations for three jobs (Job 0, Job 1, and Job 2) on shared machines to minimize the total completion time (makespan). Each job consists of a sequence of operations with specific processing times: Job 0 has two operations (Operation 0 takes 9 units of time, Operation 1 takes 8 units), Job 1 has three operations (Operation 0 takes 8 units, Operation 1 takes 8 units, Operation 2 takes 4 units), and Job 2 has four operations (Operation 0 takes 1 unit, Operation 1 takes 6 units, Operation 2 takes 4 units, Operation 3 takes 2 units). Operations within a job must follow a strict order, meaning each operation cannot start until the previous one in the same job has finished. For example, Operation 1 of Job 0 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 0 has completed after 9 units of time, Operation 1 of Job 1 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 1 has completed after 8 units of time, and Operation 2 of Job 1 cannot start until Operation 1 of Job 1 has completed after 8 units of time. Similarly, Operation 1 of Job 2 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 2 has completed after 1 unit of time, Operation 2 of Job 2 cannot start until Operation 1 of Job 2 has completed after 6 units of time, and Operation 3 of Job 2 cannot start until Operation 2 of Job 2 has completed after 4 units of time.

Certain operations from different jobs share the same machine and cannot overlap in time. For instance, Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 1 of Job 2 are assigned to the same machine, so one must finish before the other starts. Similarly, Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 1 of Job 1 share a machine, and their schedules must not overlap. This applies to all pairs of operations sharing the same machine, such as Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 2, Operation 1 of Job 1 and Operation 0 of Job 2, Operation 0 of Job 1 and Operation 2 of Job 2, Operation 0 of Job 1 and Operation 3 of Job 2, Operation 2 of Job 1 and Operation 2 of Job 2, Operation 2 of Job 1 and Operation 3 of Job 2, and Operation 2 of Job 2 and Operation 3 of Job 2.

To enforce these constraints, binary variables are used to determine the order of operations on shared machines. A large constant (100000) is used in the constraints to ensure that operations on the same machine do not overlap. For example, if Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 1 of Job 2 are on the same machine, the constraints ensure that one operation starts only after the other has finished, using the binary variable to decide the order. The binary variables are restricted to values of 0 or 1, and the start times of operations are continuous and non-negative.

The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, it must be at least 9 units of time (completion of Operation 0 of Job 0), 8 units (completion of Operation 1 of Job 0), 8 units (completion of Operation 0 of Job 1), 8 units (completion of Operation 1 of Job 1), 4 units (completion of Operation 2 of Job 1), 1 unit (completion of Operation 0 of Job 2), 6 units (completion of Operation 1 of Job 2), 4 units (completion of Operation 2 of Job 2), and 2 units (completion of Operation 3 of Job 2).

The objective is to determine the start times for each operation on each machine such that all precedence and machine capacity constraints are satisfied, and the total completion time (makespan) is minimized. This involves deciding the order of operations on shared machines and ensuring no overlaps, while respecting the processing times and sequence constraints of each job.","\[

4,"Imagine you are managing a supply chain network for a company that operates across three key locations: **Node 0**, **Node 1**, and **Node 2**. Each location has specific supply and demand requirements, and your goal is to optimize the flow of goods between these nodes while minimizing the total cost of establishing connections and shipping products.

#### Supply and Demand:
- **Node 0** has a net supply of **236 units**, meaning it can provide this amount to other nodes.
- **Node 1** has a net demand of **29 units**, requiring this amount to be fulfilled from other nodes.
- **Node 2** has a net demand of **207 units**, which must also be met through shipments from other nodes.

#### Shipping Costs and Capacities:
To move goods between nodes, you must decide whether to establish a connection (which incurs a fixed cost) and how much to ship (which incurs a variable cost per unit). The costs and capacities for each possible connection are as follows:

1. **Node 0 to Node 1**:
   - Fixed cost to establish the connection: **$3,532**
   - Variable shipping cost per unit: **$45**
   - Maximum shipping capacity: **773 units**

2. **Node 0 to Node 2**:
   - Fixed cost: **$3,895**
   - Variable shipping cost: **$49**
   - Maximum capacity: **973 units**

3. **Node 1 to Node 0**:
   - Fixed cost: **$3,485**
   - Variable shipping cost: **$11**
   - Maximum capacity: **785 units**

4. **Node 1 to Node 2**:
   - Fixed cost: **$1,845**
   - Variable shipping cost: **$40**
   - Maximum capacity: **787 units**

5. **Node 2 to Node 0**:
   - Fixed cost: **$1,291**
   - Variable shipping cost: **$13**
   - Maximum capacity: **602 units**

6. **Node 2 to Node 1**:
   - Fixed cost: **$1,818**
   - Variable shipping cost: **$47**
   - Maximum capacity: **766 units**

#### Key Decisions:
- For each connection between nodes, you must decide whether to establish it (a binary decision: yes or no).
- For each established connection, you must determine the amount of goods to ship, ensuring it does not exceed the connection's capacity.

#### Objective:
Your goal is to minimize the total cost, which includes:
1. The fixed costs of establishing the necessary connections.
2. The variable shipping costs based on the amount of goods transported.

#### Constraints:
1. **Capacity Constraints**: The amount of goods shipped between any two nodes cannot exceed the maximum capacity of that connection. For example, if you decide to ship goods from **Node 0 to Node 1**, the shipment must be **773 units or less**.
2. **Flow Balance Constraints**: The total inflow and outflow of goods at each node must match its supply or demand. For example:
   - At **Node 0**, the total inflow from **Node 1** and **Node 2** minus the outflow to **Node 1** and **Node 2** must equal **236 units**.
   - At **Node 1**, the total inflow from **Node 0** and **Node 2** minus the outflow to **Node 0** and **Node 2** must equal **-29 units** (indicating a net demand).
   - At **Node 2**, the total inflow from **Node 0** and **Node 1** minus the outflow to **Node 0** and **Node 1** must equal **-207 units** (indicating a net demand).

#### Summary:
Your task is to determine the most cost-effective way to establish connections and ship goods between **Node 0**, **Node 1**, and **Node 2** to meet the supply and demand requirements while minimizing the total cost. This involves balancing fixed and variable costs, adhering to capacity limits, and ensuring the flow of goods aligns with the needs of each node.","\[

   - At **Node 1**, the total inflow from **Node 0** and **Node 2** minus the outflow to **Node 0** and **Node 2** must equal **-29 units** (indicating a net demand).
   - At **Node 2**, the total inflow from **Node 0** and **Node 1** minus the outflow to **Node 0** and **Node 1** must equal **-207 units** (indicating a net demand).

#### Summary:
Your task is to determine the most cost-effective way to establish connections and ship goods between **Node 0**, **Node 1**, and **Node 2** to meet the supply and demand requirements while minimizing the total cost. This involves balancing fixed and variable costs, adhering to capacity limits, and ensuring the flow of goods aligns with the needs of each node.",7364,1
5,"The problem involves scheduling the landing times of four aircraft (aircraft_0, aircraft_1, aircraft_2, aircraft_3) at an airport to minimize the total penalty costs associated with deviations from their earliest possible landing times while adhering to separation and timing constraints. Each aircraft has an earliest and latest possible landing time, and penalty costs for landing early or late. Aircraft_0 has an earliest time of 0 minutes, latest time of 37 minutes, early penalty of \$61 per minute, and late penalty of \$82 per minute. Aircraft_1 has an earliest time of 7 minutes, latest time of 67 minutes, early penalty of \$35 per minute, and late penalty of \$34 per minute. Aircraft_2 has an earliest time of 225 minutes, latest time of 285 minutes, early penalty of \$74 per minute, and late penalty of \$41 per minute. Aircraft_3 has an earliest time of 119 minutes, latest time of 179 minutes, early penalty of \$93 per minute, and late penalty of \$56 per minute.

The landing order between any two aircraft must be explicitly determined using binary decision variables, ensuring one lands before the other. Separation constraints are enforced based on these landing orders, with coefficients modifying the required separation time depending on the landing sequence. For example, if aircraft_0 lands before aircraft_1, the separation constraint is adjusted by coefficients such as 2 and 30 depending on the order. Similar adjustments apply to other pairs: aircraft_0 and aircraft_2, aircraft_0 and aircraft_3, aircraft_1 and aircraft_2, aircraft_1 and aircraft_3, and aircraft_2 and aircraft_3. These constraints ensure that the separation between consecutive landings is maintained according to the specific coefficients provided in the LP data.

Each aircraft must land within its specified earliest and latest possible landing times. Early deviations are calculated as the difference between the earliest time and the actual landing time if the aircraft lands early, and late deviations are calculated as the difference between the actual landing time and the earliest time if the aircraft lands late. The total penalty cost is the sum of the early and late penalties for all aircraft, weighted by their respective penalty rates. The objective is to determine the optimal landing times for all four aircraft to minimize the total penalty costs while ensuring all separation and timing constraints are satisfied.","\[

7,"The manufacturing facility produces custom orders for three jobs: Job 0, Job 1, and Job 2. Each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be performed in a specific order, with each operation requiring a specific duration. The facility has limited machines, and some operations from different jobs must share the same machine. The goal is to schedule all operations to minimize the total completion time (makespan).

Job 0 has two operations: Operation 0 and Operation 1. Operation 1 cannot start until Operation 0 has finished, with at least 8 hours between their start times. The makespan must be at least 8 hours after the start of Operation 0 and at least 5 hours after the start of Operation 1.

Job 1 has five operations: Operation 0, Operation 1, Operation 2, Operation 3, and Operation 4. Operation 1 cannot start until Operation 0 has finished, with at least 7 hours between their start times. Operation 2 cannot start until Operation 1 has finished, with at least 9 hours between their start times. Operation 3 cannot start until Operation 2 has finished, with at least 5 hours between their start times. Operation 4 cannot start until Operation 3 has finished, with at least 6 hours between their start times. The makespan must be at least 7 hours after the start of Operation 0, 9 hours after the start of Operation 1, 5 hours after the start of Operation 2, 6 hours after the start of Operation 3, and 2 hours after the start of Operation 4.

Job 2 has five operations: Operation 0, Operation 1, Operation 2, Operation 3, and Operation 4. Operation 1 cannot start until Operation 0 has finished, with at least 9 hours between their start times. Operation 2 cannot start until Operation 1 has finished, with at least 5 hours between their start times. Operation 3 cannot start until Operation 2 has finished, with at least 8 hours between their start times. Operation 4 cannot start until Operation 3 has finished, with at least 3 hours between their start times. The makespan must be at least 9 hours after the start of Operation 0, 5 hours after the start of Operation 1, 8 hours after the start of Operation 2, 3 hours after the start of Operation 3, and 1 hour after the start of Operation 4.

Certain operations from different jobs share machines and must be scheduled without overlap. The following pairs of operations share machines: Operation 0 of Job 1 and Operation 2 of Job 1; Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 3 of Job 2; Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 1 of Job 2; Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 2 of Job 2; Operation 1 of Job 2 and Operation 2 of Job 2; Operation 4 of Job 1 and Operation 0 of Job 2. The scheduling system must determine the order of these operations to avoid conflicts, using binary variables to enforce the order. A large constant (100000) is used in the constraints to ensure that the order of operations sharing machines is respected.

The objective is to determine the start times for all operations such that all precedence constraints within each job are satisfied, no two operations sharing the same machine overlap in time, and the total completion time (makespan) is minimized. The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. All start times must be non-negative. The binary variables are used to enforce the order of operations sharing machines, and the large constant ensures that the constraints are properly applied. The start times and the makespan are general variables, and the objective is explicitly to minimize the makespan.","\[

m.optimize()",29,,"The manufacturing facility produces custom orders for three jobs: Job 0, Job 1, and Job 2. Each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be performed in a specific order, with each operation requiring a specific duration. The facility has limited machines, and some operations from different jobs must share the same machine. The goal is to schedule all operations to minimize the total completion time (makespan).

Job 0 has two operations: Operation 0 and Operation 1. Operation 1 cannot start until Operation 0 has finished, with at least 8 hours between their start times. The makespan must be at least 8 hours after the start of Operation 0 and at least 5 hours after the start of Operation 1.

Job 1 has five operations: Operation 0, Operation 1, Operation 2, Operation 3, and Operation 4. Operation 1 cannot start until Operation 0 has finished, with at least 7 hours between their start times. Operation 2 cannot start until Operation 1 has finished, with at least 9 hours between their start times. Operation 3 cannot start until Operation 2 has finished, with at least 5 hours between their start times. Operation 4 cannot start until Operation 3 has finished, with at least 6 hours between their start times. The makespan must be at least 7 hours after the start of Operation 0, 9 hours after the start of Operation 1, 5 hours after the start of Operation 2, 6 hours after the start of Operation 3, and 2 hours after the start of Operation 4.

Job 2 has five operations: Operation 0, Operation 1, Operation 2, Operation 3, and Operation 4. Operation 1 cannot start until Operation 0 has finished, with at least 9 hours between their start times. Operation 2 cannot start until Operation 1 has finished, with at least 5 hours between their start times. Operation 3 cannot start until Operation 2 has finished, with at least 8 hours between their start times. Operation 4 cannot start until Operation 3 has finished, with at least 3 hours between their start times. The makespan must be at least 9 hours after the start of Operation 0, 5 hours after the start of Operation 1, 8 hours after the start of Operation 2, 3 hours after the start of Operation 3, and 1 hour after the start of Operation 4.

Certain operations from different jobs share machines and must be scheduled without overlap. The following pairs of operations share machines: Operation 0 of Job 1 and Operation 2 of Job 1; Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 3 of Job 2; Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 1 of Job 2; Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 2 of Job 2; Operation 1 of Job 2 and Operation 2 of Job 2; Operation 4 of Job 1 and Operation 0 of Job 2. The scheduling system must determine the order of these operations to avoid conflicts, using binary variables to enforce the order. A large constant (100000) is used in the constraints to ensure that the order of operations sharing machines is respected.

The objective is to determine the start times for all operations such that all precedence constraints within each job are satisfied, no two operations sharing the same machine overlap in time, and the total completion time (makespan) is minimized. The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. All start times must be non-negative. The binary variables are used to enforce the order of operations sharing machines, and the large constant ensures that the constraints are properly applied. The start times and the makespan are general variables, and the objective is explicitly to minimize the makespan.",29,1

The fixed costs are 2960 units for L0, 3834 for L1, 2998 for L2, 4562 for L3, 3636 for L4, 1972 for L5, and 1570 for L6.

The frequency of each line must be between 2 and 10 trips per unit time if the line is selected. The total vehicle usage across all lines must not exceed the available fleet of 35 vehicles. Vehicle usage per trip is 66 units for L0, 113 for L1, 142 for L2, 179 for L3, 89 for L4, 106 for L5, and 129 for L6.

10,"A manufacturing facility produces custom orders for two jobs, Job 0 and Job 1. Each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be performed in a specific order, and some operations require the use of shared machinery. The goal is to schedule these operations to minimize the total production time, or makespan, ensuring all orders are completed as quickly as possible.

Job 0 has three operations: Operation 0, Operation 1, and Operation 2. Operation 1 must start at least 8 units of time after Operation 0 completes, and Operation 2 must start at least 1 unit of time after Operation 1 completes. Job 1 has six operations: Operation 0, Operation 1, Operation 2, Operation 3, Operation 4, and Operation 5. Operation 1 must start at least 5 units of time after Operation 0 completes, Operation 2 must start at least 5 units of time after Operation 1 completes, Operation 3 must start at least 7 units of time after Operation 2 completes, Operation 4 must start at least 4 units of time after Operation 3 completes, and Operation 5 must start at least 2 units of time after Operation 4 completes.

Some operations from both jobs require the use of the same machine, and only one operation can be processed on a machine at any given time. The following pairs of operations share the same machine: Operation 3 and Operation 4 of Job 1, Operation 0 and Operation 1 of Job 0, Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 2 of Job 1, and Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 2 of Job 1. For each pair of operations sharing a machine, a decision must be made about which operation is processed first. This decision is represented by a binary variable, where a value of 1 indicates that the first operation in the pair is processed before the second, and a value of 0 indicates the opposite.

The primary objective is to minimize the total production time, or makespan, which is defined as the time at which the last operation across all jobs is completed. The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation in both jobs. Specifically, the makespan must be at least 8 units of time after Operation 0 of Job 0 completes, at least 1 unit of time after Operation 1 of Job 0 completes, at least 4 units of time after Operation 2 of Job 0 completes, at least 5 units of time after Operation 0 of Job 1 completes, at least 5 units of time after Operation 1 of Job 1 completes, at least 7 units of time after Operation 2 of Job 1 completes, at least 4 units of time after Operation 3 of Job 1 completes, at least 2 units of time after Operation 4 of Job 1 completes, and at least 9 units of time after Operation 5 of Job 1 completes.

All operation start times must be non-negative, meaning no operation can start before time zero. For each pair of operations sharing a machine, the following must hold: if Operation A is scheduled before Operation B, then Operation B cannot start until Operation A has been completed, and conversely, if Operation B is scheduled before Operation A, then Operation A cannot start until Operation B has been completed. These constraints are enforced using a large constant (100,000) to ensure that the scheduling logic is maintained. The specific values derived from this constant, such as 99996, 99992, and 99999, are used in the constraints to enforce the sequencing logic.

The task is to determine the optimal schedule for all operations in both jobs, ensuring that all precedence and machine capacity constraints are satisfied, and that the total production time (makespan) is minimized. This involves deciding the order of operations on shared machines and ensuring that all operations are completed as quickly as possible.","\[

11,"The problem involves scheduling the landing times of three aircraft (Aircraft 0, Aircraft 1, and Aircraft 2) to minimize the total penalty costs associated with landing early or late. Each aircraft has a target landing time, and the actual landing time must fall within a specified earliest and latest possible landing time window. Aircraft 0 must land between 24 and 84 minutes, Aircraft 1 between 180 and 240 minutes, and Aircraft 2 between 215 and 275 minutes. The penalties for landing early are \$21, \$16, and \$49 per minute for Aircraft 0, 1, and 2, respectively. The penalties for landing late are \$57, \$34, and \$45 per minute for Aircraft 0, 1, and 2, respectively. The target landing times are defined such that Aircraft 0 must land no earlier than 54 minutes, Aircraft 1 no earlier than 210 minutes, and Aircraft 2 no earlier than 245 minutes. 

To ensure safe landings, separation times between aircraft must be maintained based on the order in which they land. Binary variables determine the order of landings between any two aircraft. If Aircraft 0 lands before Aircraft 1, there must be at least 5 minutes between their landings; if Aircraft 1 lands before Aircraft 0, the separation must be at least 96 minutes. If Aircraft 0 lands before Aircraft 2, the separation must be at least 4 minutes; if Aircraft 2 lands before Aircraft 0, the separation must be at least 131 minutes. If Aircraft 1 lands before Aircraft 2, the separation must be at least 5 minutes; if Aircraft 2 lands before Aircraft 1, the separation must be at least 25 minutes. Additionally, if Aircraft 0 lands before Aircraft 1, the separation must be at least 216 minutes; if Aircraft 1 lands before Aircraft 0, the separation must be at least 2 minutes. If Aircraft 0 lands before Aircraft 2, the separation must be at least 251 minutes; if Aircraft 2 lands before Aircraft 0, the separation must be at least 1 minute. If Aircraft 1 lands before Aircraft 2, the separation must be at least 95 minutes; if Aircraft 2 lands before Aircraft 1, the separation must be at least 3 minutes.

The objective is to determine the landing times for each aircraft that minimize the total penalty costs, which are calculated as the sum of the early and late penalties for all aircraft. The early penalty for each aircraft is the number of minutes it lands before its target time multiplied by its early penalty rate, and the late penalty is the number of minutes it lands after its target time multiplied by its late penalty rate. The solution must ensure that all aircraft land within their respective time windows and that the separation times between landings are respected based on the order in which the aircraft land. The decision variables include the actual landing times for each aircraft and binary variables that determine the order of landings between any two aircraft.

12,"In a manufacturing facility, you are tasked with scheduling the production of two distinct jobs, Job 0 and Job 1, across a set of machines. Each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be performed in a specific order, and each operation requires a certain amount of time to complete. The goal is to minimize the total production time, known as the makespan, while ensuring that all operations are scheduled without overlapping on the same machine and that the sequence of operations within each job is respected.

Job 0 consists of two operations: Operation 0 takes 5 units of time to complete, and Operation 1 can only start after Operation 0 has finished. The makespan must be at least 5 units of time after the start of Operation 0 and at least 2 units of time after the start of Operation 1.

Job 1 consists of five operations: Operation 0 takes 9 units of time to complete, Operation 1 takes 9 units of time and can only start after Operation 0 has finished, Operation 2 takes 7 units of time and can only start after Operation 1 has finished, Operation 3 takes 2 units of time and can only start after Operation 2 has finished, and Operation 4 takes 8 units of time and can only start after Operation 3 has finished. The makespan must be at least 9 units of time after the start of Operation 0, at least 9 units of time after the start of Operation 1, at least 7 units of time after the start of Operation 2, at least 2 units of time after the start of Operation 3, and at least 8 units of time after the start of Operation 4.

Certain operations from Job 1 must be performed on the same machine, and their scheduling must avoid overlaps. Specifically, Operation 0 and Operation 4 of Job 1 cannot overlap on the same machine. If Operation 0 starts first, Operation 4 must start at least 8 units of time after Operation 0 finishes. Conversely, if Operation 4 starts first, Operation 0 must start at least 9 units of time after Operation 4 finishes. Similarly, Operation 2 and Operation 3 of Job 1 cannot overlap on the same machine. If Operation 2 starts first, Operation 3 must start at least 2 units of time after Operation 2 finishes. Conversely, if Operation 3 starts first, Operation 2 must start at least 7 units of time after Operation 3 finishes.

The primary objective is to minimize the makespan, which is the total time taken to complete all operations across both jobs. The makespan must be at least as long as the completion time of the last operation in either job. All operations must start at or after time 0, and the order of operations within each job must be strictly followed. The scheduling of operations on shared machines must respect the no-overlap constraints described above. Binary variables are used to enforce the no-overlap constraints on the shared machines, ensuring that the operations do not overlap and the sequence constraints are satisfied.","\[

m.optimize()",35,,"In a manufacturing facility, you are tasked with scheduling the production of two distinct jobs, Job 0 and Job 1, across a set of machines. Each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be performed in a specific order, and each operation requires a certain amount of time to complete. The goal is to minimize the total production time, known as the makespan, while ensuring that all operations are scheduled without overlapping on the same machine and that the sequence of operations within each job is respected.

Job 0 consists of two operations: Operation 0 takes 5 units of time to complete, and Operation 1 can only start after Operation 0 has finished. The makespan must be at least 5 units of time after the start of Operation 0 and at least 2 units of time after the start of Operation 1.

Job 1 consists of five operations: Operation 0 takes 9 units of time to complete, Operation 1 takes 9 units of time and can only start after Operation 0 has finished, Operation 2 takes 7 units of time and can only start after Operation 1 has finished, Operation 3 takes 2 units of time and can only start after Operation 2 has finished, and Operation 4 takes 8 units of time and can only start after Operation 3 has finished. The makespan must be at least 9 units of time after the start of Operation 0, at least 9 units of time after the start of Operation 1, at least 7 units of time after the start of Operation 2, at least 2 units of time after the start of Operation 3, and at least 8 units of time after the start of Operation 4.

Certain operations from Job 1 must be performed on the same machine, and their scheduling must avoid overlaps. Specifically, Operation 0 and Operation 4 of Job 1 cannot overlap on the same machine. If Operation 0 starts first, Operation 4 must start at least 8 units of time after Operation 0 finishes. Conversely, if Operation 4 starts first, Operation 0 must start at least 9 units of time after Operation 4 finishes. Similarly, Operation 2 and Operation 3 of Job 1 cannot overlap on the same machine. If Operation 2 starts first, Operation 3 must start at least 2 units of time after Operation 2 finishes. Conversely, if Operation 3 starts first, Operation 2 must start at least 7 units of time after Operation 3 finishes.

The primary objective is to minimize the makespan, which is the total time taken to complete all operations across both jobs. The makespan must be at least as long as the completion time of the last operation in either job. All operations must start at or after time 0, and the order of operations within each job must be strictly followed. The scheduling of operations on shared machines must respect the no-overlap constraints described above. Binary variables are used to enforce the no-overlap constraints on the shared machines, ensuring that the operations do not overlap and the sequence constraints are satisfied.",35,1
13,"There are two aircraft, **aircraft_0** and **aircraft_1**, that need to be scheduled for landing. The goal is to minimize the total penalty costs associated with deviations from their target landing times. **aircraft_0** must land between 0 and 30 units of time, while **aircraft_1** must land between 128 and 188 units of time. The target landing time for **aircraft_0** is 0 units, and for **aircraft_1**, it is 158 units. Penalties are incurred for deviations from the target times: **aircraft_0** incurs a penalty of 42 units per unit time for landing early and 32 units per unit time for landing late, while **aircraft_1** incurs a penalty of 62 units per unit time for landing early and 55 units per unit time for landing late.

To ensure safety, a minimum separation time must be maintained between the landings of the two aircraft. If **aircraft_0** lands before **aircraft_1**, there must be at least 3 units of separation time. If **aircraft_1** lands before **aircraft_0**, there must be at least 98 units of separation time. The order of landings is determined by binary variables **AircraftOrder[aircraft_0,aircraft_1]** and **AircraftOrder[aircraft_1,aircraft_0]**, which are mutually exclusive and must sum to 1. The landing times must respect the separation requirements based on the landing order, and each aircraft must land within its specified time window.

The early and late deviations for each aircraft are calculated based on the difference between the actual landing time and the target time. For **aircraft_0**, the early deviation is non-negative, and the late deviation is non-negative.

15,"The problem involves scheduling four jobs (Job 0, Job 1, Job 2, and Job 3) on a set of machines to minimize the total completion time (makespan). Each job consists of a sequence of operations, and each operation must be processed on a specific machine with a given processing time. Job 0 has two operations: Operation 0 takes 2 units of time, and Operation 1 takes 3 units of time. Job 1 has five operations: Operation 0 takes 8 units of time, Operation 1 takes 7 units of time, Operation 2 takes 4 units of time, Operation 3 takes 3 units of time, and Operation 4 takes 2 units of time. Job 2 has five operations: Operation 0 takes 8 units of time, Operation 1 takes 3 units of time, Operation 2 takes 7 units of time, Operation 3 takes 8 units of time, and Operation 4 takes 4 units of time. Job 3 has seven operations: Operation 0 takes 6 units of time, Operation 1 takes 4 units of time, Operation 2 takes 7 units of time, Operation 3 takes 6 units of time, Operation 4 takes 2 units of time, Operation 5 takes 8 units of time, and Operation 6 takes 9 units of time.

Each operation in a job must start only after the previous operation in the same job has completed. For example, in Job 1, Operation 1 cannot start until Operation 0 has finished, and in Job 3, Operation 6 cannot start until Operation 5 has finished. No two operations can be processed on the same machine at the same time. For example, if Operation 3 of Job 1 and Operation 4 of Job 2 are assigned to the same machine, they cannot overlap, and the start time of one must be at least 4 units after the other, depending on the order in which they are scheduled. Similarly, Operation 1 of Job 1 and Operation 2 of Job 3 cannot overlap on the same machine, and the start time of one must be at least 7 units after the other.

The total completion time (makespan) must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, the makespan must be at least 2 units to account for the completion of Operation 0 in Job 0, and it must also be at least 9 units to account for the completion of Operation 6 in Job 3. The objective is to minimize the makespan, which involves determining the start times for each operation on each machine while respecting the precedence and machine capacity constraints. All start times must be non-negative, and the order of operations on each machine is determined by binary decision variables, which decide whether one operation starts before another on the same machine. A large constant (100000) is used in the machine capacity constraints to ensure that the constraints are only active when the binary variable is 1 or 0.

The binary decision variables, such as \(X_{(1,3)(2,4)}\), \(X_{(1,3)(3,0)}\), and others, determine the order of operations on the same machine. For example, \(X_{(1,3)(2,4)}\) decides whether Operation 3 of Job 1 starts before Operation 4 of Job 2 on the same machine. The constraints involving these binary variables ensure that the start times of operations on the same machine do not overlap. The start times \(S_{(i,j)}\) and the makespan \(C_{\text{max}}\) are general variables that can take non-negative real values. The precedence constraints between operations of different jobs on the same machine, such as those involving \(S_{(1,3)}\), \(S_{(2,4)}\), and \(S_{(3,0)}\), are explicitly enforced to ensure that the operations are scheduled in a feasible order.","\[

m.optimize()",7,,"The problem involves scheduling four jobs (Job 0, Job 1, Job 2, and Job 3) on a set of machines to minimize the total completion time (makespan). Each job consists of a sequence of operations, and each operation must be processed on a specific machine with a given processing time. Job 0 has two operations: Operation 0 takes 2 units of time, and Operation 1 takes 3 units of time. Job 1 has five operations: Operation 0 takes 8 units of time, Operation 1 takes 7 units of time, Operation 2 takes 4 units of time, Operation 3 takes 3 units of time, and Operation 4 takes 2 units of time. Job 2 has five operations: Operation 0 takes 8 units of time, Operation 1 takes 3 units of time, Operation 2 takes 7 units of time, Operation 3 takes 8 units of time, and Operation 4 takes 4 units of time. Job 3 has seven operations: Operation 0 takes 6 units of time, Operation 1 takes 4 units of time, Operation 2 takes 7 units of time, Operation 3 takes 6 units of time, Operation 4 takes 2 units of time, Operation 5 takes 8 units of time, and Operation 6 takes 9 units of time.

Each operation in a job must start only after the previous operation in the same job has completed. For example, in Job 1, Operation 1 cannot start until Operation 0 has finished, and in Job 3, Operation 6 cannot start until Operation 5 has finished. No two operations can be processed on the same machine at the same time. For example, if Operation 3 of Job 1 and Operation 4 of Job 2 are assigned to the same machine, they cannot overlap, and the start time of one must be at least 4 units after the other, depending on the order in which they are scheduled. Similarly, Operation 1 of Job 1 and Operation 2 of Job 3 cannot overlap on the same machine, and the start time of one must be at least 7 units after the other.

The total completion time (makespan) must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, the makespan must be at least 2 units to account for the completion of Operation 0 in Job 0, and it must also be at least 9 units to account for the completion of Operation 6 in Job 3. The objective is to minimize the makespan, which involves determining the start times for each operation on each machine while respecting the precedence and machine capacity constraints. All start times must be non-negative, and the order of operations on each machine is determined by binary decision variables, which decide whether one operation starts before another on the same machine. A large constant (100000) is used in the machine capacity constraints to ensure that the constraints are only active when the binary variable is 1 or 0.

The binary decision variables, such as \(X_{(1,3)(2,4)}\), \(X_{(1,3)(3,0)}\), and others, determine the order of operations on the same machine. For example, \(X_{(1,3)(2,4)}\) decides whether Operation 3 of Job 1 starts before Operation 4 of Job 2 on the same machine. The constraints involving these binary variables ensure that the start times of operations on the same machine do not overlap. The start times \(S_{(i,j)}\) and the makespan \(C_{\text{max}}\) are general variables that can take non-negative real values. The precedence constraints between operations of different jobs on the same machine, such as those involving \(S_{(1,3)}\), \(S_{(2,4)}\), and \(S_{(3,0)}\), are explicitly enforced to ensure that the operations are scheduled in a feasible order.",42,0
16,"The problem involves scheduling the landing times of six aircraft at a busy airport to minimize the total penalty costs associated with deviations from their target landing times while ensuring safe separation between landings. Each aircraft has a target landing time, earliest and latest possible landing times, and penalty costs for landing early or late. The landing times must fall within the specified bounds for each aircraft: Aircraft 0 between 8 and 68 minutes, Aircraft 1 between 46 and 106 minutes, Aircraft 2 between 90 and 150 minutes, Aircraft 3 between 16 and 76 minutes, Aircraft 4 between 0 and 57 minutes, and Aircraft 5 between 39 and 99 minutes. The penalties are calculated based on the deviation from the target landing times, with specific costs per minute for early or late landings: 55 for early landing of Aircraft 0, 94 for Aircraft 1, 61 for Aircraft 2, 64 for Aircraft 3, 74 for Aircraft 4, and 84 for Aircraft 5; and 38 for late landing of Aircraft 0, 81 for Aircraft 1, 71 for Aircraft 2, 80 for Aircraft 3, 53 for Aircraft 4, and 84 for Aircraft 5. The binary decision variables ensure that for each pair of aircraft, one lands before the other, and the separation times are enforced based on the landing order. The separation constraints include specific times such as 22 minutes between Aircraft 0 and 1, 22 minutes between Aircraft 0 and 2, 5 minutes between Aircraft 0 and 3, 3 minutes between Aircraft 0 and 4, 3 minutes between Aircraft 0 and 5, 4 minutes between Aircraft 1 and 2, 3 minutes between Aircraft 1 and 3, 1 minute between Aircraft 1 and 4, 5 minutes between Aircraft 1 and 5, 2 minutes between Aircraft 2 and 3, 1 minute between Aircraft 2 and 4, 5 minutes between Aircraft 2 and 5, 5 minutes between Aircraft 3 and 4, 3 minutes between Aircraft 3 and 5, and 5 minutes between Aircraft 4 and 5. The goal is to determine the actual landing times for all six aircraft such that the total penalty cost is minimized, and all separation and landing time constraints are satisfied. The binary decision variables `AircraftOrder[i,j]` are used to determine the landing order, and the constraints involving `Early` and `Late` variables ensure that the landing times are within the acceptable deviations from the target times. The target landing times for each aircraft are implied by the constraints involving `Early` and `Late` variables, and the `AircraftOrder` variables are binary, ensuring that one aircraft lands before the other in each pair. The relationship between the separation constraints and the binary decision variables is essential for understanding the problem structure.","\[

The penalties for landing early or late are as follows: aircraft_0 incurs a penalty of 58 units per minute early and 57 units per minute late, aircraft_1 incurs 25 units per minute early and 61 units per minute late, and aircraft_2 incurs 37 units per minute early and 70 units per minute late.

The landing sequence between any two aircraft is determined by binary variables, where a value of 1 indicates that one aircraft lands before the other. The constraints ensure that the landing times respect the sequence and separation requirements. For example, if aircraft_0 lands before aircraft_1, there must be at least 4 minutes of separation, but if aircraft_1 lands before aircraft_0, the required separation is 21 minutes. Similarly, if aircraft_0 lands before aircraft_2, the separation must be at least 12 minutes, but if aircraft_2 lands before aircraft_0, the separation must be at least 126 minutes.

Penalties are incurred for landing early or late, with specific costs per unit time for each aircraft: aircraft 0 has an early penalty of 62 and a late penalty of 82, aircraft 1 has an early penalty of 10 and a late penalty of 65, aircraft 2 has an early penalty of 89 and a late penalty of 72, aircraft 3 has an early penalty of 81 and a late penalty of 69, and aircraft 4 has an early penalty of 50 and a late penalty of 42. The separation requirements between aircraft depend on the order in which they land, and these requirements are enforced using binary decision variables that determine the landing sequence. The separation times are as follows: between aircraft 0 and 1, the required separation is 203 if 0 lands before 1 and 3 if 1 lands before 0; between aircraft 0 and 2, the required separation is 2 if 0 lands before 2 and 28 if 2 lands before 0; between aircraft 0 and 3, the required separation is 4 if 0 lands before 3 and 238 if 3 lands before 0; between aircraft 0 and 4, the required separation is 5 if 0 lands before 4 and 169 if 4 lands before 0; between aircraft 1 and 2, the required separation is 3 if 1 lands before 2 and 171 if 2 lands before 1; between aircraft 1 and 3, the required separation is 2 if 1 lands before 3 and 95 if 3 lands before 1; between aircraft 1 and 4, the required separation is 4 if 1 lands before 4 and 26 if 4 lands before 1; between aircraft 2 and 3, the required separation is 5 if 2 lands before 3 and 300 if 3 lands before 2; between aircraft 2 and 4, the required separation is 2 if 2 lands before 4 and 231 if 4 lands before 2; between aircraft 3 and 4, the required separation is 5 if 3 lands before 4 and 29 if 4 lands before 3. The objective is to minimize the sum of the penalties for early and late landings across all aircraft. The constraints include ensuring that each aircraft lands within its time window, enforcing the separation times based on the landing order, and calculating the penalties for deviations from the target landing times. The binary decision variables ensure that only one of the two possible orders between any pair of aircraft is chosen, and the separation constraints are applied accordingly. The landing times must also satisfy bounds that are specific to each aircraft. The penalties are calculated based on the difference between the actual landing time and the target landing time, with separate variables for early and late deviations. The goal is to find the optimal landing times and sequence that minimize the total penalty costs while satisfying all constraints.","\[

Each aircraft has a target landing time, an earliest possible landing time, and a latest possible landing time. Aircraft 0 must land between 178 and 238, aircraft 1 between 35 and 95, aircraft 2 between 266 and 300, aircraft 3 between 0 and 40, and aircraft 4 between 69 and 129.

19,"There are six jobs, each with a specific sequence of operations that must be performed on shared machines to complete their tasks. The goal is to schedule these operations to minimize the total time (makespan) required to complete all jobs. Each job has a predefined sequence of operations with specific processing times. Job 0 has two operations: the first takes 1 unit of time, and the second takes 6 units. Job 1 has two operations: the first takes 4 units, and the second takes 2 units. Job 2 has three operations: the first takes 9 units, the second takes 2 units, and the third takes 2 units. Job 3 has four operations: the first takes 5 units, the second takes 7 units, the third takes 6 units, and the fourth takes 3 units. Job 4 has four operations: the first takes 2 units, the second takes 9 units, the third takes 8 units, and the fourth takes 7 units. Job 5 has two operations: the first takes 4 units, and the second takes 8 units.

Operations from different jobs may share the same machine, and the order in which they are processed must be determined. For example, the second operation of Job 0 and the fourth operation of Job 3 share a machine. If Job 0闁炽儲鐛�second operation starts first, it must finish before Job 3闁炽儲鐛�fourth operation begins, or vice versa. Similarly, the second operation of Job 1 and the second operation of Job 2 share a machine. If Job 1闁炽儲鐛�second operation starts first, it must finish before Job 2闁炽儲鐛�second operation begins, or vice versa.

Each job闁炽儲鐛�operations must be performed in a specific order. For Job 0, the second operation cannot start until the first operation is completed. For Job 1, the second operation cannot start until the first operation is completed. For Job 2, the second operation cannot start until the first operation is completed, and the third operation cannot start until the second operation is completed. For Job 3, the second operation cannot start until the first operation is completed, the third operation cannot start until the second operation is completed, and the fourth operation cannot start until the third operation is completed. For Job 4, the second operation cannot start until the first operation is completed, the third operation cannot start until the second operation is completed, and the fourth operation cannot start until the third operation is completed. For Job 5, the second operation cannot start until the first operation is completed.

The objective is to minimize the total time (makespan) required to complete all operations for all jobs. The makespan is determined by the latest completion time among all operations. The constraints include precedence constraints, which ensure that each operation starts only after its preceding operation in the same job闁炽儲鐛�sequence is completed. For example, Job 0闁炽儲鐛�second operation must start at least 1 unit of time after the first operation starts. Job 1闁炽儲鐛�second operation must start at least 4 units of time after the first operation starts. Job 2闁炽儲鐛�second operation must start at least 9 units of time after the first operation starts, and the third operation must start at least 2 units of time after the second operation starts. Job 3闁炽儲鐛�second operation must start at least 5 units of time after the first operation starts, the third operation must start at least 7 units of time after the second operation starts, and the fourth operation must start at least 6 units of time after the third operation starts. Job 4闁炽儲鐛�second operation must start at least 2 units of time after the first operation starts, the third operation must start at least 9 units of time after the second operation starts, and the fourth operation must start at least 8 units of time after the third operation starts. Job 5闁炽儲鐛�second operation must start at least 4 units of time after the first operation starts.

Machine capacity constraints ensure that operations sharing the same machine do not overlap. For example, if Job 0闁炽儲鐛�second operation starts first on a shared machine, it must finish before Job 3闁炽儲鐛�fourth operation begins, or vice versa. A large constant (100,000) is used to enforce the order of operations on shared machines. Non-negativity constraints ensure that all operation start times are non-negative. Binary decision variables determine the order of operations on shared machines.

The processing times for each operation are fixed and provided. The precedence constraints specify the minimum time gaps between operations. The machine capacity constraints ensure that operations on shared machines do not overlap. The decisions to be made include determining the start time for each operation for all jobs, deciding the order of operations on shared machines using binary variables, and ensuring that all constraints are satisfied while minimizing the total makespan. The objective is to minimize the total time (makespan) required to complete all operations for all jobs, ensuring that all precedence and machine capacity constraints are met.","\[

Job 0 has three operations: Operation 0 takes 2 hours, Operation 1 takes 8 hours, and Operation 2 takes 5 hours. Job 1 has two operations: Operation 0 takes 1 hour, and Operation 1 takes 7 hours.

For Job 0, Operation 1 cannot start until Operation 0 has finished, with at least 2 hours between the finish of Operation 0 and the start of Operation 1. Operation 2 cannot start until Operation 1 has finished, with at least 8 hours between the finish of Operation 1 and the start of Operation 2.

For Job 1, Operation 1 cannot start until Operation 0 has finished, with at least 1 hour between the finish of Operation 0 and the start of Operation 1.

Operations on shared machines cannot overlap.

21,"The problem involves scheduling operations for three jobs (Job 0, Job 1, and Job 2) on a set of machines in a manufacturing facility to minimize the total completion time (makespan). Each job consists of a sequence of operations with specific processing times. Job 0 has 5 operations with processing times of 7, 9, 8, 3, and 9 hours. Job 1 has 6 operations with processing times of 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, and 9 hours. Job 2 has 7 operations with processing times of 9, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, and 5 hours. Each operation must start only after the previous operation in the same job has been completed. For example, Operation 1 of Job 0 cannot start until Operation 0 has been completed (7 hours), and Operation 1 of Job 1 cannot start until Operation 0 has been completed (1 hour). Operations from different jobs that require the same machine must be scheduled in a specific order to avoid overlapping. Binary decision variables determine the order of operations on shared machines. For instance, if Operation 0 of Job 0 is scheduled before Operation 0 of Job 1, the binary variable is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. A large constant (100,000) is used in the constraints to ensure they are only active when necessary. The makespan must be at least as long as the completion time of the last operation across all jobs. The start times for all operations must be non-negative, and the objective is to minimize the makespan while satisfying all precedence and machine capacity constraints. Specifically, the constraints include precedence constraints within each job, machine capacity constraints to prevent overlapping operations on the same machine, and makespan constraints to ensure the makespan is at least as large as the completion time of every operation. The binary variables are used to enforce the order of operations on shared machines, and the large constant ensures the constraints are only active when necessary. The start times and the makespan are continuous variables, and the binary variables are restricted to 0 or 1. The machine capacity constraints are formulated such that for each pair of operations assigned to the same machine, the start time of one operation plus its processing time must be less than or equal to the start time of the other operation plus the large constant multiplied by the complement of the binary variable. This ensures that the operations do not overlap on the same machine. The makespan constraints ensure that the makespan is at least as large as the completion time of every operation. The precedence constraints ensure that operations within the same job are scheduled in the correct order. The binary variables are used to determine the order of operations on shared machines, and the large constant is used to make the constraints active only when necessary.

22,"The problem involves scheduling four jobs (Job 0, Job 1, Job 2, and Job 3) across multiple machines to minimize the total completion time (makespan). Each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be performed in a specific order, and each operation is assigned to a particular machine. The processing times for each operation are as follows: Job 0 has Operation 0 (6 units), Operation 1 (8 units), and Operation 2 (9 units); Job 1 has Operation 0 (3 units), Operation 1 (8 units), Operation 2 (5 units), Operation 3 (5 units), and Operation 4 (2 units); Job 2 has Operation 0 (8 units), Operation 1 (1 unit), and Operation 2 (6 units); Job 3 has Operation 0 (1 unit), Operation 1 (9 units), Operation 2 (4 units), and Operation 3 (5 units).

Each machine can process only one operation at a time. If two operations are assigned to the same machine, they cannot overlap in time. The order of operations on the same machine is determined by binary decision variables. For example, if Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 3 of Job 1 are on the same machine, the binary variable determines whether Operation 0 of Job 0 is processed before Operation 3 of Job 1 or vice versa. Similar constraints apply to other operation pairs on the same machine, such as Operation 2 of Job 1 and Operation 4 of Job 1, Operation 2 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 2, Operation 2 of Job 0 and Operation 3 of Job 3, Operation 0 of Job 2 and Operation 3 of Job 3, Operation 0 of Job 1 and Operation 1 of Job 2, Operation 0 of Job 1 and Operation 2 of Job 3, and Operation 1 of Job 2 and Operation 2 of Job 3.

The objective is to minimize the makespan, which must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, the completion time of Operation 0 of Job 0 is at least 6 units, so the makespan must be at least 6 units. Similarly, the completion time of Operation 1 of Job 0 is at least 8 units, so the makespan must be at least 8 units. This applies to all operations, with the final operation of Job 3 requiring at least 5 units.

Constraints include precedence constraints within jobs, ensuring that each operation starts only after the previous operation in the same job has completed. For example, Operation 1 of Job 0 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 0 has completed, which takes at least 6 units. Machine capacity constraints ensure that operations assigned to the same machine do not overlap, with binary variables determining the order of operations on the same machine. The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation, and all start times for operations must be non-negative. Binary variables must be either 0 or 1, determining the order of operations on the same machine.

The goal is to find the optimal schedule that meets all these constraints while minimizing the total time required to complete all jobs.","\[

# Solve the model
m.optimize()",28,,"The problem involves scheduling four jobs (Job 0, Job 1, Job 2, and Job 3) across multiple machines to minimize the total completion time (makespan). Each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be performed in a specific order, and each operation is assigned to a particular machine. The processing times for each operation are as follows: Job 0 has Operation 0 (6 units), Operation 1 (8 units), and Operation 2 (9 units); Job 1 has Operation 0 (3 units), Operation 1 (8 units), Operation 2 (5 units), Operation 3 (5 units), and Operation 4 (2 units); Job 2 has Operation 0 (8 units), Operation 1 (1 unit), and Operation 2 (6 units); Job 3 has Operation 0 (1 unit), Operation 1 (9 units), Operation 2 (4 units), and Operation 3 (5 units).

Each machine can process only one operation at a time. If two operations are assigned to the same machine, they cannot overlap in time. The order of operations on the same machine is determined by binary decision variables. For example, if Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 3 of Job 1 are on the same machine, the binary variable determines whether Operation 0 of Job 0 is processed before Operation 3 of Job 1 or vice versa. Similar constraints apply to other operation pairs on the same machine, such as Operation 2 of Job 1 and Operation 4 of Job 1, Operation 2 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 2, Operation 2 of Job 0 and Operation 3 of Job 3, Operation 0 of Job 2 and Operation 3 of Job 3, Operation 0 of Job 1 and Operation 1 of Job 2, Operation 0 of Job 1 and Operation 2 of Job 3, and Operation 1 of Job 2 and Operation 2 of Job 3.

The objective is to minimize the makespan, which must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, the completion time of Operation 0 of Job 0 is at least 6 units, so the makespan must be at least 6 units. Similarly, the completion time of Operation 1 of Job 0 is at least 8 units, so the makespan must be at least 8 units. This applies to all operations, with the final operation of Job 3 requiring at least 5 units.

Constraints include precedence constraints within jobs, ensuring that each operation starts only after the previous operation in the same job has completed. For example, Operation 1 of Job 0 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 0 has completed, which takes at least 6 units. Machine capacity constraints ensure that operations assigned to the same machine do not overlap, with binary variables determining the order of operations on the same machine. The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation, and all start times for operations must be non-negative. Binary variables must be either 0 or 1, determining the order of operations on the same machine.

The goal is to find the optimal schedule that meets all these constraints while minimizing the total time required to complete all jobs.",28,1
23,"Imagine you are managing a supply chain network for a company that operates across six key locations (nodes). Each location has specific supply and demand requirements, and your goal is to optimize the flow of goods between these locations while minimizing the total cost, which includes both fixed costs for establishing connections and variable costs for shipping goods.

#### Supply and Demand:
- **Location 0** has a demand of 116 units.
- **Location 1** has a demand of 134 units.
- **Location 2** has no net supply or demand (balance is 0).
- **Location 3** has a demand of 141 units.
- **Location 4** has a demand of 8 units.
- **Location 5** has a demand of 101 units.

#### Costs and Capacities:
To establish a connection between any two locations, there is a fixed cost. Additionally, shipping goods between locations incurs a variable cost per unit. Each connection also has a maximum capacity, limiting the amount of goods that can be shipped.

Here are the specific costs and capacities for each possible connection:

- **Fixed Costs (for establishing connections):**
  - From Location 0: To Location 1 costs 1972, to Location 2 costs 2030, to Location 3 costs 2048, to Location 4 costs 1951, to Location 5 costs 2043.
  - From Location 1: To Location 0 costs 1993, to Location 2 costs 2029, to Location 3 costs 1975, to Location 4 costs 1967, to Location 5 costs 2026.
  - From Location 2: To Location 0 costs 2042, to Location 1 costs 1973, to Location 3 costs 2001, to Location 4 costs 2034, to Location 5 costs 2035.
  - From Location 3: To Location 0 costs 2007, to Location 1 costs 1968, to Location 2 costs 2004, to Location 4 costs 1996, to Location 5 costs 1969.
  - From Location 4: To Location 0 costs 1973, to Location 1 costs 1955, to Location 2 costs 2038, to Location 3 costs 1953, to Location 5 costs 2000.
  - From Location 5: To Location 0 costs 1999, to Location 1 costs 2031, to Location 2 costs 2011, to Location 3 costs 1965, to Location 4 costs 1984.

- **Variable Costs (per unit shipped):**
  - From Location 0: To Location 1 costs 21, to Location 2 costs 19, to Location 3 costs 20, to Location 4 costs 21, to Location 5 costs 21.
  - From Location 1: To Location 0 costs 21, to Location 2 costs 19, to Location 3 costs 21, to Location 4 costs 19, to Location 5 costs 20.
  - From Location 2: To Location 0 costs 20, to Location 1 costs 20, to Location 3 costs 21, to Location 4 costs 21, to Location 5 costs 20.
  - From Location 3: To Location 0 costs 19, to Location 1 costs 19, to Location 2 costs 20, to Location 4 costs 19, to Location 5 costs 20.
  - From Location 4: To Location 0 costs 20, to Location 1 costs 19, to Location 2 costs 20, to Location 3 costs 20, to Location 5 costs 19.
  - From Location 5: To Location 0 costs 21, to Location 1 costs 20, to Location 2 costs 20, to Location 3 costs 19, to Location 4 costs 21.

- **Maximum Capacities (units that can be shipped):**
  - From Location 0: To Location 1 can handle up to 137 units, to Location 2 up to 154 units, to Location 3 up to 189 units, to Location 4 up to 188 units, to Location 5 up to 247 units.
  - From Location 1: To Location 0 up to 163 units, to Location 2 up to 197 units, to Location 3 up to 242 units, to Location 4 up to 191 units, to Location 5 up to 135 units.
  - From Location 2: To Location 0 up to 226 units, to Location 1 up to 155 units, to Location 3 up to 182 units, to Location 4 up to 189 units, to Location 5 up to 160 units.
  - From Location 3: To Location 0 up to 179 units, to Location 1 up to 232 units, to Location 2 up to 210 units, to Location 4 up to 146 units, to Location 5 up to 241 units.
  - From Location 4: To Location 0 up to 238 units, to Location 1 up to 164 units, to Location 2 up to 238 units, to Location 3 up to 218 units, to Location 5 up to 195 units.
  - From Location 5: To Location 0 up to 237 units, to Location 1 up to 191 units, to Location 2 up to 165 units, to Location 3 up to 133 units, to Location 4 up to 191 units.

#### Objective:
Your task is to determine which connections to establish and how much to ship between locations to meet all demand requirements while minimizing the total cost. The total cost includes both the fixed costs of establishing connections and the variable costs of shipping goods.

#### Constraints:
1. **Capacity Constraints:** The amount of goods shipped between any two locations cannot exceed the maximum capacity of that connection.
2. **Flow Balance:** The total amount of goods entering a location minus the total amount leaving must equal the net supply or demand at that location.
3. **Binary Decisions:** For each connection, you must decide whether to establish it (yes or no), which incurs the fixed cost.

By carefully analyzing these factors, you aim to find the most cost-effective way to manage the supply chain network, ensuring all locations receive the goods they need without exceeding capacity limits or incurring unnecessary costs.","\[

24,"You are tasked with optimizing the deployment of cell towers across a region to maximize population coverage while adhering to a strict budget constraint. The region is divided into 33 distinct areas, each with a specific population size that needs to be covered by cell tower signals. The goal is to determine which cell towers to build and which areas to cover to ensure the maximum number of people have access to cellular service.

For each of the 29 available cell tower locations (tower_0 to tower_28), you must decide whether to build the tower (a binary decision: build or not build). For each of the 33 regions (region_0 to region_32), you must decide whether the region will be covered by at least one active cell tower (a binary decision: cover or not cover).

The objective is to maximize the total population covered by the deployed cell towers. The population sizes for the regions are as follows: Region 0: 4,901; Region 1: 2,727; Region 2: 2,994; Region 3: 2,984; Region 4: 3,693; Region 5: 2,615; Region 6: 3,354; Region 7: 4,965; Region 8: 4,223; Region 9: 4,738; Region 10: 2,345; Region 11: 3,915; Region 12: 4,068; Region 13: 2,613; Region 14: 3,140; Region 15: 4,894; Region 16: 3,503; Region 17: 3,733; Region 18: 4,275; Region 19: 3,795; Region 20: 3,803; Region 21: 3,497; Region 22: 2,403; Region 23: 3,441; Region 24: 3,116; Region 25: 2,091; Region 26: 4,494; Region 27: 3,593; Region 28: 2,090; Region 29: 3,397; Region 30: 3,973; Region 31: 2,362; Region 32: 2,068.

Each region can only be considered covered if at least one of the cell towers that can serve it is built. For example, Region 0 can be covered if any of the following towers are built: Tower 1, Tower 2, Tower 3, Tower 4, Tower 5, Tower 6, Tower 9, Tower 12, Tower 14, Tower 15, Tower 16, Tower 17, Tower 19, or Tower 26. Similar constraints apply to all 33 regions, with each region having a specific set of towers that can provide coverage.

The total cost of building the selected cell towers must not exceed the available budget of 2,996 units. The costs for building each tower are as follows: Tower 0: 227; Tower 1: 355; Tower 2: 287; Tower 3: 487; Tower 4: 497; Tower 5: 412; Tower 6: 495; Tower 7: 294; Tower 8: 212; Tower 9: 290; Tower 10: 427; Tower 11: 399; Tower 12: 361; Tower 13: 253; Tower 14: 350; Tower 15: 314; Tower 16: 234; Tower 17: 203; Tower 18: 257; Tower 19: 248; Tower 20: 406; Tower 21: 264; Tower 22: 277; Tower 23: 419; Tower 24: 426; Tower 25: 297; Tower 26: 474; Tower 27: 333; Tower 28: 491.

Your task is to select which cell towers to build and which regions to cover, ensuring that the total population covered is maximized while staying within the budget. Each region can only be covered if at least one of its associated towers is built, and the total cost of building the selected towers must not exceed 2,996 units. The solution must balance the trade-off between coverage and cost to achieve the best possible outcome.","\[

m.optimize()",33135,,"You are tasked with optimizing the deployment of cell towers across a region to maximize population coverage while adhering to a strict budget constraint. The region is divided into 33 distinct areas, each with a specific population size that needs to be covered by cell tower signals. The goal is to determine which cell towers to build and which areas to cover to ensure the maximum number of people have access to cellular service.

For each of the 29 available cell tower locations (tower_0 to tower_28), you must decide whether to build the tower (a binary decision: build or not build). For each of the 33 regions (region_0 to region_32), you must decide whether the region will be covered by at least one active cell tower (a binary decision: cover or not cover).

The objective is to maximize the total population covered by the deployed cell towers. The population sizes for the regions are as follows: Region 0: 4,901; Region 1: 2,727; Region 2: 2,994; Region 3: 2,984; Region 4: 3,693; Region 5: 2,615; Region 6: 3,354; Region 7: 4,965; Region 8: 4,223; Region 9: 4,738; Region 10: 2,345; Region 11: 3,915; Region 12: 4,068; Region 13: 2,613; Region 14: 3,140; Region 15: 4,894; Region 16: 3,503; Region 17: 3,733; Region 18: 4,275; Region 19: 3,795; Region 20: 3,803; Region 21: 3,497; Region 22: 2,403; Region 23: 3,441; Region 24: 3,116; Region 25: 2,091; Region 26: 4,494; Region 27: 3,593; Region 28: 2,090; Region 29: 3,397; Region 30: 3,973; Region 31: 2,362; Region 32: 2,068.

Each region can only be considered covered if at least one of the cell towers that can serve it is built. For example, Region 0 can be covered if any of the following towers are built: Tower 1, Tower 2, Tower 3, Tower 4, Tower 5, Tower 6, Tower 9, Tower 12, Tower 14, Tower 15, Tower 16, Tower 17, Tower 19, or Tower 26. Similar constraints apply to all 33 regions, with each region having a specific set of towers that can provide coverage.

The total cost of building the selected cell towers must not exceed the available budget of 2,996 units. The costs for building each tower are as follows: Tower 0: 227; Tower 1: 355; Tower 2: 287; Tower 3: 487; Tower 4: 497; Tower 5: 412; Tower 6: 495; Tower 7: 294; Tower 8: 212; Tower 9: 290; Tower 10: 427; Tower 11: 399; Tower 12: 361; Tower 13: 253; Tower 14: 350; Tower 15: 314; Tower 16: 234; Tower 17: 203; Tower 18: 257; Tower 19: 248; Tower 20: 406; Tower 21: 264; Tower 22: 277; Tower 23: 419; Tower 24: 426; Tower 25: 297; Tower 26: 474; Tower 27: 333; Tower 28: 491.

Your task is to select which cell towers to build and which regions to cover, ensuring that the total population covered is maximized while staying within the budget. Each region can only be covered if at least one of its associated towers is built, and the total cost of building the selected towers must not exceed 2,996 units. The solution must balance the trade-off between coverage and cost to achieve the best possible outcome.",113803,0

#### Objective:
Your task is to determine the optimal amount of resources to ship between cities to meet all demands and supplies while minimizing the total transportation cost. The shipments must respect the capacity limits of each route, and the total flow of resources into and out of each city must balance according to their respective requirements.

#### Constraints:
1. **Flow Balance**: For each city, the total resources shipped into the city plus its supply must equal the total resources shipped out of the city plus its demand.
2. **Capacity Limits**: The amount of resources shipped on any route cannot exceed the maximum capacity for that route.
3. **Non-Negativity**: All shipments must be non-negative.

By carefully planning the shipments, you aim to achieve the lowest possible total cost while ensuring all cities receive the resources they need.","\[

#### Objective:
Your task is to determine the optimal amount of resources to ship between cities to meet all demands and supplies while minimizing the total transportation cost. The shipments must respect the capacity limits of each route, and the total flow of resources into and out of each city must balance according to their respective requirements.

#### Constraints:
1. **Flow Balance**: For each city, the total resources shipped into the city plus its supply must equal the total resources shipped out of the city plus its demand.
2. **Capacity Limits**: The amount of resources shipped on any route cannot exceed the maximum capacity for that route.
3. **Non-Negativity**: All shipments must be non-negative.

By carefully planning the shipments, you aim to achieve the lowest possible total cost while ensuring all cities receive the resources they need.",493,0

For each job, the second operation cannot start until the first operation is completed. If two operations are assigned to the same machine, they must be scheduled in a specific order, determined by binary decision variables.

Decide whether to establish a connection between each pair of facilities, where establishing a connection incurs a fixed cost. Determine the amount of goods to transport between connected facilities, ensuring that the total flow does not exceed the connection's capacity. The total incoming goods minus the total outgoing goods must equal the facility's net demand for each facility. The decision to establish a connection is binary.

Decide whether to establish a connection between each pair of facilities, where establishing a connection incurs a fixed cost. Determine the amount of goods to transport between connected facilities, ensuring that the total flow does not exceed the connection's capacity. The total incoming goods minus the total outgoing goods must equal the facility's net demand for each facility. The decision to establish a connection is binary. The goal is to minimize the total cost, which includes both the fixed costs of establishing connections and the variable costs of transporting goods.",13022,0

The position variables for City 1 to City 5 must be between 0 and 5, while the position variable for City 0 has no specified bounds. Additionally, constraints ensure that if a route is taken from one city to another, the position of the first city must be less than the position of the second city, adjusted by a factor to eliminate subtours.

35,"The problem involves scheduling 7 jobs, each consisting of 2 operations, on a set of machines to minimize the total production time, or makespan. Each operation has a processing time of 1 unit of time. Operations within the same job must follow a specific sequence: operation 0 must be completed before operation 1 can begin. Some operations from different jobs are assigned to the same machine, and the machine can only process one operation at a time. The order in which operations are scheduled on a shared machine is determined by binary decision variables, which take a value of 1 if one operation is scheduled before another and 0 otherwise. A large constant of 100,000 is used to enforce that operations on the same machine do not overlap in time. The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation, ensuring it accounts for the longest-running job. Start times for all operations must be non-negative, and the binary variables must be either 0 or 1. Specific machine assignments include operations (4,1), (5,0), and (6,0) on one machine; (0,1) and (3,0) on another; (0,0), (2,0), and (4,0) on another; and (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), and (5,1) on another.

m.optimize()",2,,"The problem involves scheduling 7 jobs, each consisting of 2 operations, on a set of machines to minimize the total production time, or makespan. Each operation has a processing time of 1 unit of time. Operations within the same job must follow a specific sequence: operation 0 must be completed before operation 1 can begin. Some operations from different jobs are assigned to the same machine, and the machine can only process one operation at a time. The order in which operations are scheduled on a shared machine is determined by binary decision variables, which take a value of 1 if one operation is scheduled before another and 0 otherwise. A large constant of 100,000 is used to enforce that operations on the same machine do not overlap in time. The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation, ensuring it accounts for the longest-running job. Start times for all operations must be non-negative, and the binary variables must be either 0 or 1. Specific machine assignments include operations (4,1), (5,0), and (6,0) on one machine; (0,1) and (3,0) on another; (0,0), (2,0), and (4,0) on another; and (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), and (5,1) on another.

Product 2 has cumulative demands of 57, 143, 193, 263, 363, and 428 units. Production costs per unit for Product 0 are $42, $47, $41, $40, $43, and $47 across the six months. For Product 1, they are $43, $50, $41, $50, $49, and $46. For Product 2, they are $42, $49, $40, $47, $49, and $45. Setup costs for Product 0 are $1,282, $1,493, $1,006, $1,286, $1,305, and $1,360. For Product 1, they are $1,402, $1,498, $1,296, $1,366, $1,376, and $1,172. For Product 2, they are $1,362, $1,094, $1,283, $1,279, $1,430, and $1,146. Inventory holding costs per unit for Product 0 are $4, $5, $4, $5, $4, and $4. For Product 1, they are $5, $5, $5, $4, $4, and $4. For Product 2, they are $5, $5, $4, $5, $5, and $4. The facility has monthly resource capacities of 1,173, 1,102, 1,018, 1,077, 1,190, and 1,132 units. Each unit of Product 0 consumes 1.778 resource units, Product 1 consumes 1.502, and Product 2 consumes 1.556. If a product is produced in a month, a setup cost is incurred, and production quantities are limited by setup decisions: Product 0 can produce up to 469, 394, 328, 228, 154, and 83 units; Product 1 up to 390, 325, 239, 162, 104, and 52 units; and Product 2 up to 428, 371, 285, 235, 165, and 65 units. Inventory at the end of each month must satisfy demand, and no initial or final inventory is allowed. The objective is to determine optimal production quantities, setup decisions, and inventory levels to minimize total costs while meeting demand and resource constraints.","\[

41," Facility Location for Maximum Dispersion

You are tasked with selecting a set of facilities from a network of five potential locations (Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, and Node 4) to maximize the overall dispersion between the selected facilities. Dispersion is measured by the weighted distances between pairs of facilities, where higher weights indicate greater desirability for separation. The goal is to ensure that the selected facilities are as spread out as possible, given the constraints.

#### Key Decisions:
1. **Facility Selection**: Decide which facilities to open. Each facility can either be selected (1) or not selected (0). Specifically, you must select exactly 2 facilities out of the 5 available.
2. **Pairwise Dispersion**: Determine whether a pair of facilities contributes to the dispersion score. A pair contributes only if both facilities in the pair are selected.

#### Objective:
Maximize the total dispersion score, which is the sum of the weighted distances between all pairs of selected facilities. The weights for each pair are as follows:
- Node 0 and Node 1: 22  
- Node 0 and Node 2: 19  
- Node 0 and Node 3: 24  
- Node 0 and Node 4: 22  
- Node 1 and Node 0: 19  
- Node 1 and Node 2: 23

- Node 4 and Node 0: 19  
- Node 4 and Node 1: 22  
- Node 4 and Node 2: 19  
- Node 4 and Node 3: 21  

#### Constraints:
1. **Facility Selection Limit**: Exactly 2 facilities must be selected from the 5 available. This means the sum of the selection decisions for all facilities must equal 2.
2. **Pairwise Contribution Rules**:
   - A pair of facilities can only contribute to the dispersion score if both facilities in the pair are selected.
   - If either facility in a pair is not selected, the pair cannot contribute to the dispersion score.
   - If both facilities in a pair are selected, the pair must contribute to the dispersion score.

#### Numerical Parameters:
- The weights for each pair of facilities are explicitly provided in the objective section above.
- The total number of facilities to select is fixed at 2.

#### Summary:
Your task is to select 2 facilities out of 5 such that the total dispersion score, calculated as the sum of the weighted distances between all selected pairs, is maximized. The selection must adhere to the constraints that ensure only valid pairs contribute to the dispersion score and that exactly 2 facilities are chosen.","\[

42,"The problem involves scheduling production tasks for five jobs (Job 0 through Job 4) in a manufacturing facility. Each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be performed in a specific order, with each operation taking exactly 1 unit of time to complete. The facility has a limited number of machines, and certain operations from different jobs may require the same machine. The goal is to minimize the total production time, known as the makespan, while ensuring that all operational constraints are satisfied.

Each operation within a job must start only after the previous operation in the same job is completed. For example, Operation 1 of Job 0 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 0 is finished. Operations that require the same machine cannot overlap in time. To enforce this, binary decision variables are used to determine the order of operations on each machine. For instance, if Operation 0 of Job 0 is scheduled before Operation 0 of Job 1 on Machine 1, the binary variable \( X_{(0,0),(1,0)} \) is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. A large constant (100000) is used in the constraints to ensure that the sequencing is properly enforced.

The makespan must be at least as long as the completion time of the last operation across all jobs. For example, if Operation 1 of Job 4 finishes at time 10, the makespan must be at least 10. All operation start times must be non-negative, and the binary decision variables can only take values of 0 or 1.

The objective is to determine the start times for all operations and the sequence of operations on shared machines such that the total production time is minimized. This must be done while ensuring that all precedence constraints, machine capacity constraints, and non-negativity constraints are satisfied. The processing time for each operation is fixed at 1 unit of time, and the binary decision variables are used to enforce the order of operations on shared machines.","\[

Each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be performed in a specific order, with each operation taking exactly 1 unit of time to complete. The facility has a limited number of machines, and certain operations from different jobs may require the same machine. The goal is to minimize the total production time, known as the makespan, while ensuring that all operational constraints are satisfied.

Each operation within a job must start only after the previous operation in the same job is completed. For example, Operation 1 of Job 0 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 0 is finished. Operations that require the same machine cannot overlap in time. To enforce this, binary decision variables are used to determine the order of operations on each machine. For instance, if Operation 0 of Job 0 is scheduled before Operation 0 of Job 1 on Machine 1, the binary variable \( X_{(0,0),(1,0)} \) is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. A large constant (100000) is used in the constraints to ensure that the sequencing is properly enforced.

The makespan must be at least as long as the completion time of the last operation across all jobs. For example, if Operation 1 of Job 4 finishes at time 10, the makespan must be at least 10. All operation start times must be non-negative, and the binary decision variables can only take values of 0 or 1.

The objective is to determine the start times for all operations and the sequence of operations on shared machines such that the total production time is minimized. This must be done while ensuring that all precedence constraints, machine capacity constraints, and non-negativity constraints are satisfied. The processing time for each operation is fixed at 1 unit of time, and the binary decision variables are used to enforce the order of operations on shared machines.",5,0

45,"You are tasked with optimizing the placement of facilities across a network of five locations (Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, and Node 4) to maximize the overall benefit derived from their interactions. Each location has the potential to host a facility, but due to budget constraints, you can only select **exactly 3 locations** to establish facilities. The goal is to maximize the total benefit generated by the interactions between the selected facilities.

#### Key Details:
1. **Facility Selection**: You must choose exactly 3 out of the 5 locations to establish facilities. Each location can either be selected (1) or not selected (0).
2. **Interaction Benefits**: The benefit of interaction between any two facilities depends on the specific pair of locations. For example:
   - If facilities are placed at Node 0 and Node 1, the interaction benefit is **16**.
   - If facilities are placed at Node 0 and Node 2, the interaction benefit is **20**.
   - Similarly, the interaction benefits for all other pairs are provided in the table below.

3. **Interaction Rules**:
   - An interaction benefit is only counted if **both facilities in the pair are selected**. For example, if Node 0 and Node 1 are both selected, the interaction benefit of 16 is added to the total.
   - If only one facility in a pair is selected, no interaction benefit is counted for that pair.

4. **Interaction Benefit Table**:
   | Pair of Nodes | Interaction Benefit |
   |---------------|---------------------|
   | Node 0 & Node 1 | 16                  |
   | Node 0 & Node 2 | 20                  |
   | Node 0 & Node 3 | 18                  |
   | Node 0 & Node 4 | 22                  |
   | Node 1 & Node 0 | 25                  |
   | Node 1 & Node 2 | 24                  |
   | Node 1 & Node 3 | 17                  |
   | Node 1 & Node 4 | 16                  |
   | Node 2 & Node 0 | 19                  |
   | Node 2 & Node 1 | 22                  |

   | Node 4 & Node 1 | 19                  |
   | Node 4 & Node 2 | 22                  |
   | Node 4 & Node 3 | 16                  |

5. **Constraints**:
   - **Facility Selection Constraint**: Exactly 3 facilities must be selected out of the 5 locations.
   - **Interaction Constraints**: For each pair of locations, the interaction benefit is only counted if both facilities in the pair are selected. This is enforced by ensuring that:
     - If either facility in a pair is not selected, the interaction benefit for that pair is not counted.
     - If both facilities in a pair are selected, the interaction benefit is fully counted.

6. **Objective**:
   - Maximize the total interaction benefit across all selected facility pairs.

#### Example:
Suppose you select facilities at Node 0, Node 1, and Node 2. The total interaction benefit would be calculated as follows:
- Node 0 & Node 1: 16
- Node 0 & Node 2: 20
- Node 1 & Node 2: 24  
Total Benefit = 16 + 20 + 24 = **60**

49,"The problem involves determining the most cost-effective way to transport medical supplies across a network of 10 hospitals (node_0 to node_9) while minimizing total transportation costs. Each hospital is interconnected, and the cost of transporting supplies between any two hospitals varies. The decision variables are binary, representing whether a route between two hospitals is used (1) or not (0). The objective is to minimize the total cost of transporting supplies, calculated as the sum of the costs of all activated routes.

The constraints ensure that the supply balance is maintained across all hospitals. Specifically, node_0 must have a net supply of +1, indicating it is the source of supplies, while node_9 must have a net supply of -1, indicating it is the destination. All intermediate hospitals (node_1 to node_8) must have a net supply of 0, meaning they neither gain nor lose supplies overall. The flow balance constraints ensure that the total flow into each hospital equals the total flow out of it, with the exception of node_0 and node_9, which have specific net supply requirements.

m.optimize()",153,,"Minimize the total penalty costs associated with landing five aircraft either earlier or later than their target times, while ensuring safe separation between consecutive landings. Each aircraft has a target landing time, earliest and latest possible landing times, and penalties for landing early or late. The penalties are \$15, \$10, \$17, \$15, and \$15 per minute early, and \$11, \$16, \$17, \$15, and \$12 per minute late for Aircraft 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The target landing times are 71, 95, 73, 80, and 78 minutes, with earliest landing times of 60, 65, 60, 60, and 60 minutes, and latest landing times of 100 minutes for all aircraft.

To ensure safety, specific separation times must be maintained between consecutive landings. If Aircraft 0 lands before Aircraft 1, there must be at least 7 minutes between their landings. If Aircraft 0 lands before Aircraft 2, there must be at least 5 minutes between their landings. If Aircraft 0 lands before Aircraft 3, there must be at least 5 minutes between their landings. If Aircraft 0 lands before Aircraft 4, there must be at least 6 minutes between their landings. If Aircraft 1 lands before Aircraft 2, there must be at least 5 minutes between their landings. If Aircraft 1 lands before Aircraft 3, there must be at least 8 minutes between their landings. If Aircraft 1 lands before Aircraft 4, there must be at least 6 minutes between their landings. If Aircraft 2 lands before Aircraft 3, there must be at least 7 minutes between their landings. If Aircraft 2 lands before Aircraft 4, there must be at least 7 minutes between their landings. If Aircraft 3 lands before Aircraft 4, there must be at least 7 minutes between their landings.

The landing time for each aircraft must be between its earliest and latest possible landing times. The separation times between consecutive landings must be enforced based on the order in which the aircraft land. The penalties for landing early or late are applied based on the deviation from the target landing times. The objective is to determine the actual landing times for all five aircraft such that the total penalty cost is minimized, each aircraft lands within its specified earliest and latest landing times, and the required separation times between consecutive landings are strictly maintained. Binary decision variables are used to determine the order of landings between aircraft pairs, ensuring proper separation based on the landing order. Constraints enforce the relationship between landing times and the binary variables, ensuring proper separation based on the landing order. The binary variables are restricted to 0 or 1.",153,1
52,"You are managing a manufacturing facility that produces three types of products (Product 0, Product 1, and Product 2) using two machines (Machine 0 and Machine 1) over three time periods (Period 0, Period 1, and Period 2). Your goal is to minimize the total operational costs, which include production setup costs, machine startup costs, inventory holding costs, and backlogging costs, while meeting customer demand for each product in each period.

For each product, machine, and time period, decide whether to produce the product and how much to produce. For each machine and time period, decide whether to start up the machine to begin production. For each product and time period, decide how much inventory to carry over to the next period or how much demand to backlog if production falls short.

Minimize the total cost, which includes production setup costs of 145.4242073380383 per production decision, machine startup costs of 79.18604813454679 per startup decision, inventory holding costs of 0.9008900951620358 for Product 0, 1.068925395295676 for Product 1, and 1.066244796883431 for Product 2 per unit per period, and backlogging costs of 6.734178682720012 for Product 0, 7.442225721133133 for Product 1, and 7.104627209109436 for Product 2 per unit per period.

For each product and time period, the total production across machines, plus any inventory carried over from the previous period, minus any backlog from the previous period, must equal the demand for that period plus the current inventory minus the current backlog. The demands for each product and period are as follows: Product 0: Period 0 = 20.33410585875594, Period 1 = 22.57961652322203, Period 2 = 15.89714240515548; Product 1: Period 0 = 24.05647618194615, Period 1 = 20.36522893983323, Period 2 = 17.47466293074195; Product 2: Period 0 = 16.36553930950429, Period 1 = 22.7831030020558, Period 2 = 19.7805033393852.

For each machine and time period, the production quantity multiplied by -71.79935969683524 for Machine 0 or -73.09691843304661 for Machine 1, plus the startup time multiplied by 6.342821301312698 for Machine 0 or 6.171760083826499 for Machine 1, plus the amount produced must be less than or equal to zero. Each machine can only produce one product at a time in any given period, meaning the sum of production decisions across all products for a given machine and period must be less than or equal to 1.

If a machine is producing a product in a period but was not producing it in the previous period, a startup decision must be made. Production quantities, inventory levels, and backlogs must be non-negative. Production and startup decisions are binary (either 0 or 1).","\[

For example, if a binary variable is 1, then one operation must finish before another starts on the same machine. The task is to determine the start times for all operations across all jobs, ensuring operations within the same job are performed in the correct sequence, operations sharing the same machine do not overlap, and the total completion time is minimized.",4,0
54," Cell Tower Coverage Planning

You are tasked with planning the deployment of cell towers across a region to maximize population coverage while adhering to a strict budget constraint. The region is divided into 35 distinct areas, each with a specific population size that needs to be served. Your goal is to determine which cell towers to build and which areas to cover to ensure the maximum number of people have access to cellular service.

#### Key Decisions:
1. **Build or Not Build**: For each of the 26 potential cell tower locations, you must decide whether to build the tower (a binary decision: build or not build).
2. **Coverage Assignment**: For each of the 35 areas, you must determine whether it will be covered by the deployed towers (a binary decision: covered or not covered).

#### Objective:
Maximize the total population covered by the deployed cell towers. The population sizes for the 35 areas are as follows:
- Area 0: 3,215 people
- Area 1: 2,395 people
- Area 2: 4,466 people
- Area 3: 2,520 people
- Area 4: 2,192 people
- Area 5: 4,625 people
- Area 6: 4,796 people
- Area 7: 2,973 people
- Area 8: 2,034 people
- Area 9: 2,754 people
- Area 10: 2,143 people
- Area 11: 2,473 people
- Area 12: 3,099 people
- Area 13: 4,136 people
- Area 14: 2,154 people
- Area 15: 3,411 people
- Area 16: 3,230 people
- Area 17: 2,155 people
- Area 18: 4,907 people
- Area 19: 2,665 people
- Area 20: 4,708 people
- Area 21: 4,494 people
- Area 22: 2,381 people
- Area 23: 3,077 people
- Area 24: 2,699 people
- Area 25: 3,320 people
- Area 26: 4,931 people
- Area 27: 4,645 people
- Area 28: 2,346 people
- Area 29: 4,393 people
- Area 30: 4,051 people
- Area 31: 4,507 people
- Area 32: 4,610 people
- Area 33: 3,412 people
- Area 34: 3,059 people

#### Constraints:
1. **Coverage Requirements**:
   - Each area can only be considered covered if at least one of the cell towers assigned to it is built. For example:
     - Area 0 can be covered if any of the towers 1, 5, 10, 11, 13, 15, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, or 24 are built.
     - Area 1 can be covered if any of the towers 3, 4, 6, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 23, or 24 are built.
     - Similar constraints apply to all 35 areas, with specific combinations of towers required for coverage.

2. **Budget Constraint**:
   - The total cost of building the selected towers must not exceed the available budget of 2,894 units. The costs for building each tower are as follows:
     - Tower 0: 411 units
     - Tower 1: 294 units
     - Tower 2: 376 units
     - Tower 3: 447 units
     - Tower 4: 414 units
     - Tower 5: 498 units
     - Tower 6: 437 units
     - Tower 7: 272 units
     - Tower 8: 381 units
     - Tower 9: 323 units
     - Tower 10: 356 units
     - Tower 11: 200 units
     - Tower 12: 297 units
     - Tower 13: 428 units
     - Tower 14: 427 units
     - Tower 15: 484 units
     - Tower 16: 494 units
     - Tower 17: 436 units
     - Tower 18: 218 units

     - Tower 20: 399 units
     - Tower 21: 484 units
     - Tower 22: 367 units
     - Tower 23: 204 units
     - Tower 24: 289 units
     - Tower 25: 283 units

3. **Binary Decisions**:
   - Each tower can either be built (1) or not built (0).
   - Each area can either be covered (1) or not covered (0).

#### Summary:
Your task is to select which towers to build and which areas to cover, ensuring that the total population covered is maximized while staying within the budget. The coverage of each area depends on the specific combination of towers built, and the total cost of building the selected towers must not exceed 2,894 units.","\[

56,"Job Shop Scheduling in a Manufacturing Facility

You are managing a manufacturing facility that produces custom parts for various clients. The facility has multiple machines, each capable of performing specific operations. There are seven jobs (Job 0 to Job 6) that need to be processed, and each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be performed in a specific order. Each operation is assigned to a particular machine, and no two operations can be processed on the same machine simultaneously.

#### Objective:
Your goal is to minimize the **makespan**, which is the total time required to complete all jobs. This ensures that all jobs are finished as quickly as possible, allowing the facility to meet client deadlines and optimize resource utilization.

#### Decisions to Be Made:
1. **Start Times**: Determine the start time for each operation of every job.
2. **Operation Order**: Decide the order in which operations are processed on each machine, ensuring no overlaps.

#### Constraints:
1. **Precedence Constraints**:
   - Each operation in a job must start only after the previous operation in the same job has been completed. For example:
     - Operation 1 of Job 0 must start at least 1 time unit after Operation 0 of Job 0 has finished.
     - Operation 1 of Job 1 must start at least 1 time unit after Operation 0 of Job 1 has finished.
     - This pattern applies to all jobs and their respective operations.

2. **Machine Capacity Constraints**:
   - No two operations assigned to the same machine can overlap in time. For example:
     - If Operation 1 of Job 3 and Operation 0 of Job 4 are assigned to the same machine, they must be scheduled such that one starts only after the other has finished. A binary decision variable determines the order of these operations.
     - Similar constraints apply to all pairs of operations sharing the same machine, such as:
       - Operation 1 of Job 3 and Operation 1 of Job 4.
       - Operation 1 of Job 3 and Operation 1 of Job 6.
       - Operation 0 of Job 4 and Operation 1 of Job 4.
       - Operation 0 of Job 4 and Operation 1 of Job 6.
       - Operation 1 of Job 4 and Operation 1 of Job 6.
       - Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 1.
       - Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 2.
       - Operation 0 of Job 1 and Operation 0 of Job 2.
       - Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 1 of Job 1.
       - Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 1 of Job 2.
       - Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 3.
       - Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 1 of Job 5.
       - Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 6.
       - Operation 1 of Job 1 and Operation 1 of Job 2.
       - Operation 1 of Job 1 and Operation 0 of Job 3.
       - Operation 1 of Job 1 and Operation 1 of Job 5.
       - Operation 1 of Job 1 and Operation 0 of Job 6.
       - Operation 1 of Job 2 and Operation 0 of Job 3.
       - Operation 1 of Job 2 and Operation 1 of Job 5.
       - Operation 1 of Job 2 and Operation 0 of Job 6.
       - Operation 0 of Job 3 and Operation 1 of Job 5.
       - Operation 0 of Job 3 and Operation 0 of Job 6.
       - Operation 1 of Job 5 and Operation 0 of Job 6.

3. **Makespan Definition**:
   - The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example:
     - The makespan must be at least 1 time unit after the completion of Operation 0 of Job 0.
     - The makespan must be at least 1 time unit after the completion of Operation 1 of Job 0.
     - This applies to all operations across all jobs.

4. **Non-Negativity**:
   - All start times must be non-negative, meaning no operation can start before time zero.

5. **Binary Variables**:
   - Binary variables are used to determine the order of operations on shared machines. For example:
     - A binary variable decides whether Operation 1 of Job 3 is processed before or after Operation 0 of Job 4 on the same machine.
     - Similar binary variables are used for all relevant pairs of operations sharing the same machine.

#### Numerical Parameters:
- The processing time for each operation is implicitly defined by the constraints, with a minimum required gap of 1 time unit between consecutive operations of the same job.
- The large constant \( N = 100,000 \) is used in the machine capacity constraints to ensure that the binary variables correctly enforce the order of operations.

#### Summary:
Your task is to schedule the start times of all operations across all jobs and machines in such a way that the total completion time (makespan) is minimized. You must ensure that all precedence and machine capacity constraints are satisfied, and that the makespan reflects the latest completion time of any operation. The use of binary variables is critical to determining the correct order of operations on shared machines.","\[

57,"The problem involves scheduling operations for five jobs (Job 0 through Job 4) in a manufacturing facility. Each job consists of two operations that must be performed in sequence, with the second operation starting only after the first operation is completed. All operations have a processing time of 1 unit. Operations from different jobs may share the same machine, and each machine can handle only one operation at a time. The goal is to minimize the total time required to complete all jobs, known as the makespan.

The start time of each operation must be determined, ensuring that the sequence of operations within each job is respected and that no two operations on the same machine overlap. Binary variables are used to determine the order of operations on shared machines. For example, if Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 2 are on the same machine, a binary variable indicates whether Operation 0 of Job 0 precedes Operation 0 of Job 2 or vice versa. A large constant (100,000) is used in the constraints to enforce the correct ordering of operations on shared machines.

The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, if Operation 0 of Job 0 finishes at time 2, the makespan must be at least 2. The constraints include precedence constraints within jobs, ensuring that the start time of the second operation is at least 1 unit after the completion of the first operation. Machine capacity constraints ensure that two operations assigned to the same machine do not overlap in time. The solution will provide a schedule that ensures all jobs are completed as quickly as possible, respecting the constraints of machine availability and operation precedence.","\[

m.optimize()",2,,"The problem involves scheduling operations for five jobs (Job 0 through Job 4) in a manufacturing facility. Each job consists of two operations that must be performed in sequence, with the second operation starting only after the first operation is completed. All operations have a processing time of 1 unit. Operations from different jobs may share the same machine, and each machine can handle only one operation at a time. The goal is to minimize the total time required to complete all jobs, known as the makespan.

The start time of each operation must be determined, ensuring that the sequence of operations within each job is respected and that no two operations on the same machine overlap. Binary variables are used to determine the order of operations on shared machines. For example, if Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 2 are on the same machine, a binary variable indicates whether Operation 0 of Job 0 precedes Operation 0 of Job 2 or vice versa. A large constant (100,000) is used in the constraints to enforce the correct ordering of operations on shared machines.

The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, if Operation 0 of Job 0 finishes at time 2, the makespan must be at least 2. The constraints include precedence constraints within jobs, ensuring that the start time of the second operation is at least 1 unit after the completion of the first operation. Machine capacity constraints ensure that two operations assigned to the same machine do not overlap in time. The solution will provide a schedule that ensures all jobs are completed as quickly as possible, respecting the constraints of machine availability and operation precedence.",4,0
58,"There are 5 jobs labeled as Job 0, Job 1, Job 2, Job 3, and Job 4, and 4 machines labeled as Machine 0, Machine 1, Machine 2, and Machine 3.

The goal is to minimize the total completion time of all jobs, which includes the start time of the job in the last schedule position (Position 4) on the last machine (Machine 3) and the processing time of that job. Each job has specific processing times on each machine: Job 0 takes 9 units on Machine 0, 7 units on Machine 1, 5 units on Machine 2, and 6 units on Machine 3; Job 1 takes 7 units on Machine 0, 10 units on Machine 1, 10 units on Machine 2, and 8 units on Machine 3; Job 2 takes 6 units on Machine 0, 9 units on Machine 1, 9 units on Machine 2, and 8 units on Machine 3; Job 3 takes 10 units on Machine 0, 10 units on Machine 1, 7 units on Machine 2, and 8 units on Machine 3; Job 4 takes 6 units on Machine 0, 10 units on Machine 1, 5 units on Machine 2, and 10 units on Machine 3. Each schedule position on each machine must be assigned exactly one job, and each job must be assigned to exactly one schedule position across all machines.

Additionally, the start time of a job in the next schedule position must be at least equal to the completion time of the job in the current position on the same machine.

The decisions include whether to produce each product on each machine in each period, whether to start up a machine for a specific product in a given period, the exact amount of each product to produce on each machine in each period, how much of each product to keep in inventory at the end of each period, and how much to backlog if demand cannot be met. 

The constraints include meeting customer demand in each period, where the total production of each product across both machines, plus any inventory carried over from the previous period, minus any backlog from the previous period, must equal the demand for that period plus the current inventory minus the current backlog. The demands are 21.53845915883999 for Product 0 in Period 0, 22.99877365370049 in Period 1, and 20.41750946364395 in Period 2; 24.34292430654904 for Product 1 in Period 0, 18.69161579278047 in Period 1, and 16.96075239636408 in Period 2; and 15.44135005337596 for Product 2 in Period 0, 24.75403844533352 in Period 1, and 17.09921582696376 in Period 2. 

The total production quantity for each product on each machine in each period, plus any startup time required, must not exceed the machine's capacity. The startup time for Machine 0 is 6.900949355420833, and for Machine 1, it is 7.255877688483005. The capacity of Machine 0 is 73.62985121550206, and for Machine 1, it is 69.3191618930891. Each machine can only be used for one product at a time in each period, meaning the sum of production decisions for all products on a single machine in a given period cannot exceed 1. 

If a machine is used to produce a product in a period but was not used for that product in the previous period, a startup cost is incurred. For the first period, a startup is automatically required if production occurs.

66," Cell Tower Deployment for Regional Coverage

You are tasked with deploying cell towers across a region to maximize population coverage while adhering to a strict budget constraint. The region is divided into 34 distinct areas, each with a specific population size that needs to be covered by the cell towers. Your goal is to determine which towers to build and which areas to cover to ensure the maximum number of people have access to cellular service.

#### Key Decisions:
1. **Tower Deployment**: Decide whether to build each of the 30 available cell towers. Each tower has a unique construction cost, and building it will enable coverage for certain areas.
2. **Area Coverage**: Determine which of the 34 areas will be covered by the deployed towers. An area is considered covered if at least one of the towers that can serve it is built.

#### Objective:
Maximize the total population covered by the deployed cell towers. The population sizes for the 34 areas are as follows:
- Area 0: 3,328 people
- Area 1: 2,066 people
- Area 2: 2,261 people
- Area 3: 4,527 people
- Area 4: 4,205 people
- Area 5: 4,927 people
- Area 6: 2,941 people
- Area 7: 4,277 people
- Area 8: 3,276 people
- Area 9: 4,326 people
- Area 10: 2,852 people
- Area 11: 3,957 people
- Area 12: 2,068 people
- Area 13: 4,724 people
- Area 14: 3,226 people
- Area 15: 3,575 people
- Area 16: 2,922 people
- Area 17: 3,850 people
- Area 18: 4,898 people
- Area 19: 2,288 people
- Area 20: 4,726 people
- Area 21: 2,513 people
- Area 22: 2,336 people
- Area 23: 4,669 people
- Area 24: 4,626 people
- Area 25: 4,585 people
- Area 26: 4,367 people
- Area 27: 4,981 people
- Area 28: 4,049 people
- Area 29: 4,948 people
- Area 30: 2,182 people
- Area 31: 2,421 people
- Area 32: 3,061 people
- Area 33: 4,310 people

#### Constraints:
1. **Coverage Requirements**: Each area must be covered by at least one of the towers that can serve it. For example:
   - Area 0 can be covered by Towers 0, 3, 4, 7, 9, 16, 17, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, or 27.
   - Area 1 can be covered by Towers 0, 1, 15, 19, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, or 29.
   - Similar coverage relationships exist for all 34 areas, as detailed in the input data.

2. **Budget Constraint**: The total cost of building the selected towers must not exceed the available budget of 3,375 units. The construction costs for the towers are:
   - Tower 0: 248 units
   - Tower 1: 226 units
   - Tower 2: 454 units
   - Tower 3: 466 units
   - Tower 4: 241 units
   - Tower 5: 201 units
   - Tower 6: 415 units
   - Tower 7: 486 units
   - Tower 8: 485 units
   - Tower 9: 492 units
   - Tower 10: 249 units
   - Tower 11: 486 units
   - Tower 12: 417 units
   - Tower 13: 327 units
   - Tower 14: 257 units
   - Tower 15: 486 units
   - Tower 16: 438 units
   - Tower 17: 266 units
   - Tower 18: 473 units
   - Tower 19: 268 units
   - Tower 20: 293 units
   - Tower 21: 379 units
   - Tower 22: 476 units
   - Tower 23: 482 units
   - Tower 24: 367 units
   - Tower 25: 239 units
   - Tower 26: 368 units
   - Tower 27: 492 units
   - Tower 28: 454 units
   - Tower 29: 319 units

3. **Binary Decisions**: Each tower can either be built (1) or not built (0), and each area can either be covered (1) or not covered (0).

#### Summary:
Your task is to select which towers to build and which areas to cover to maximize the total population served, ensuring that all coverage requirements are met and the total construction cost does not exceed the budget. The solution must account for the specific coverage capabilities of each tower and the population sizes of the areas.","\[

m.optimize()",33970,," Cell Tower Deployment for Regional Coverage

You are tasked with deploying cell towers across a region to maximize population coverage while adhering to a strict budget constraint. The region is divided into 34 distinct areas, each with a specific population size that needs to be covered by the cell towers. Your goal is to determine which towers to build and which areas to cover to ensure the maximum number of people have access to cellular service.

#### Key Decisions:
1. **Tower Deployment**: Decide whether to build each of the 30 available cell towers. Each tower has a unique construction cost, and building it will enable coverage for certain areas.
2. **Area Coverage**: Determine which of the 34 areas will be covered by the deployed towers. An area is considered covered if at least one of the towers that can serve it is built.

#### Objective:
Maximize the total population covered by the deployed cell towers. The population sizes for the 34 areas are as follows:
- Area 0: 3,328 people
- Area 1: 2,066 people
- Area 2: 2,261 people
- Area 3: 4,527 people
- Area 4: 4,205 people
- Area 5: 4,927 people
- Area 6: 2,941 people
- Area 7: 4,277 people
- Area 8: 3,276 people
- Area 9: 4,326 people
- Area 10: 2,852 people
- Area 11: 3,957 people
- Area 12: 2,068 people
- Area 13: 4,724 people
- Area 14: 3,226 people
- Area 15: 3,575 people
- Area 16: 2,922 people
- Area 17: 3,850 people
- Area 18: 4,898 people
- Area 19: 2,288 people
- Area 20: 4,726 people
- Area 21: 2,513 people
- Area 22: 2,336 people
- Area 23: 4,669 people
- Area 24: 4,626 people
- Area 25: 4,585 people
- Area 26: 4,367 people
- Area 27: 4,981 people
- Area 28: 4,049 people
- Area 29: 4,948 people
- Area 30: 2,182 people
- Area 31: 2,421 people
- Area 32: 3,061 people
- Area 33: 4,310 people

#### Constraints:
1. **Coverage Requirements**: Each area must be covered by at least one of the towers that can serve it. For example:
   - Area 0 can be covered by Towers 0, 3, 4, 7, 9, 16, 17, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, or 27.
   - Area 1 can be covered by Towers 0, 1, 15, 19, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, or 29.
   - Similar coverage relationships exist for all 34 areas, as detailed in the input data.

2. **Budget Constraint**: The total cost of building the selected towers must not exceed the available budget of 3,375 units. The construction costs for the towers are:
   - Tower 0: 248 units
   - Tower 1: 226 units
   - Tower 2: 454 units
   - Tower 3: 466 units
   - Tower 4: 241 units
   - Tower 5: 201 units
   - Tower 6: 415 units
   - Tower 7: 486 units
   - Tower 8: 485 units
   - Tower 9: 492 units
   - Tower 10: 249 units
   - Tower 11: 486 units
   - Tower 12: 417 units
   - Tower 13: 327 units
   - Tower 14: 257 units
   - Tower 15: 486 units
   - Tower 16: 438 units
   - Tower 17: 266 units
   - Tower 18: 473 units
   - Tower 19: 268 units
   - Tower 20: 293 units
   - Tower 21: 379 units
   - Tower 22: 476 units
   - Tower 23: 482 units
   - Tower 24: 367 units
   - Tower 25: 239 units
   - Tower 26: 368 units
   - Tower 27: 492 units
   - Tower 28: 454 units
   - Tower 29: 319 units

3. **Binary Decisions**: Each tower can either be built (1) or not built (0), and each area can either be covered (1) or not covered (0).

#### Summary:
Your task is to select which towers to build and which areas to cover to maximize the total population served, ensuring that all coverage requirements are met and the total construction cost does not exceed the budget. The solution must account for the specific coverage capabilities of each tower and the population sizes of the areas.",124268,0
67,"Minimize the total operational costs, which include production setup costs, machine startup costs, inventory holding costs, and backlogging costs, while meeting customer demand for each product in each period. The decisions involve determining whether to produce each product on each machine in each period, deciding whether to start up each machine for each product in each period, determining the exact quantity of each product to produce on each machine in each period, and deciding how much inventory to carry over or how much demand to backlog for each product in each period. The total cost includes production setup costs of 149.1695690337089 per production run, machine startup costs of 69.24269269143792 per machine startup, inventory holding costs of 1.080318154052025 for Product 0 and 1.143069947055348 for Product 1, and backlogging costs of 6.798895023015501 for Product 0 and 6.372651501311341 for Product 1. The constraints ensure that the total production of each product across all machines, plus any inventory carried over from the previous period, minus any backlog from the previous period, equals the demand for that product in the current period, plus any inventory carried forward, minus any backlogged demand. The demands are 22.92965094851524 units for Product 0 in Period 0, 19.03396834281949 units in Period 1, and 18.90167422155575 units in Period 2, and 19.80185049682801 units for Product 1 in Period 0, 24.22810173621122 units in Period 1, and 16.84556169689551 units in Period 2. The production quantity on each machine, plus the startup time, cannot exceed the machine's capacity, which is 76.7045484622153 for Machine 0 and 69.3695364951939 for Machine 1. Each machine can only produce one product at a time in any given period. If a machine is used for production in a period but was not used in the previous period, a startup cost is incurred. Production quantities, inventory levels, and backlogs must be non-negative, and production and startup decisions must be binary.","\[

For each OD pair, the total capacity provided by the selected lines must meet or exceed the demand. If not, the unmet demand incurs a penalty. For OD pair OD_5_9, the combined capacity of lines L_1, L_2, L_5, L_7, L_8, L_9, L_11, L_12, and L_13 must be at least 24 passengers.

69,"You are tasked with optimizing the placement of facilities across a network of five locations (Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, and Node 4) to maximize the overall dispersion between the selected facilities. Dispersion is measured by the weighted distances between pairs of facilities, where the weights represent the importance or benefit of separating specific pairs. Your goal is to select exactly three facilities out of the five possible locations while ensuring that the total dispersion benefit is maximized.

#### Key Decisions:
- **Facility Selection:** Decide which three out of the five locations will host the facilities. Each location can either be selected (1) or not selected (0).
- **Pairwise Dispersion Activation:** Determine whether the dispersion benefit between a pair of selected facilities is activated. This is represented by a binary decision (1 if both facilities in the pair are selected, 0 otherwise).

#### Objective:
Maximize the total dispersion benefit across all pairs of selected facilities. The dispersion benefit between each pair of locations is as follows:
- Node 0 and Node 1: 17 units
- Node 0 and Node 2: 18 units
- Node 0 and Node 3: 21 units
- Node 0 and Node 4: 22 units
- Node 1 and Node 0: 22 units
- Node 1 and Node 2: 15 units
- Node 1 and Node 3: 21 units
- Node 1 and Node 4: 21 units
- Node 2 and Node 0: 16 units
- Node 2 and Node 1: 21 units
- Node 2 and Node 3: 23 units
- Node 2 and Node 4: 17 units
- Node 3 and Node 0: 21 units
- Node 3 and Node 1: 22 units
- Node 3 and Node 2: 19 units
- Node 3 and Node 4: 24 units
- Node 4 and Node 0: 24 units
- Node 4 and Node 1: 16 units
- Node 4 and Node 2: 15 units
- Node 4 and Node 3: 23 units

#### Constraints:
1. **Facility Selection Limit:** Exactly three facilities must be selected out of the five locations. This means the sum of selected facilities must equal three.
2. **Pairwise Dispersion Activation Rules:**
   - The dispersion benefit between two locations can only be activated if both locations are selected.
   - If either location in a pair is not selected, the dispersion benefit for that pair cannot be activated.
   - If both locations in a pair are selected, the dispersion benefit must be activated.

#### Numerical Parameters:
- The dispersion benefits between each pair of locations are explicitly provided in the objective description above.
- The total number of facilities to be selected is fixed at three.

#### Practical Implications:
This problem ensures that the selected facilities are spread out in a way that maximizes their overall separation benefit, which could be critical in scenarios such as minimizing risk, optimizing coverage, or ensuring redundancy. The constraints ensure that the solution is both feasible and aligned with the operational requirements of selecting exactly three facilities.

By solving this problem, you will determine the optimal set of three facilities and the corresponding pairwise dispersion benefits that maximize the total separation value across the network.","\[

70," Inventory Management with Backlogging in a Retail Supply Chain

You are managing the inventory and ordering process for a retail supply chain over a 19-week period. Your goal is to minimize the total costs associated with ordering, holding inventory, and backlogging unmet demand, while ensuring that customer demand is met as efficiently as possible. The costs and constraints are as follows:

#### **Cost Components:**
1. **Ordering Costs**: Each time an order is placed in a given week, a fixed cost is incurred. These costs vary by week and are as follows:
   - Week 1: \$930, Week 2: \$881, Week 3: \$925, Week 4: \$808, Week 5: \$711, Week 6: \$785, Week 7: \$997, Week 8: \$820, Week 9: \$843, Week 10: \$631, Week 11: \$726, Week 12: \$1,071, Week 13: \$741, Week 14: \$1,157, Week 15: \$916, Week 16: \$791, Week 17: \$1,055, Week 18: \$932, Week 19: \$794.

2. **Variable Ordering Costs**: In addition to the fixed costs, there is a variable cost per unit ordered in each week. These costs are:
   - Week 1: \$40, Week 2: \$26, Week 3: \$38, Week 4: \$20, Week 5: \$25, Week 6: \$22, Week 7: \$40, Week 8: \$39, Week 9: \$25, Week 10: \$26, Week 11: \$34, Week 12: \$25, Week 13: \$26, Week 14: \$27, Week 15: \$27, Week 16: \$35, Week 17: \$23, Week 18: \$26, Week 19: \$36.

3. **Inventory Holding Costs**: Holding inventory at the end of each week incurs a cost per unit. These costs are:
   - Week 1: \$19, Week 2: \$16, Week 3: \$24, Week 4: \$23, Week 5: \$24, Week 6: \$23, Week 7: \$20, Week 8: \$21, Week 9: \$21, Week 10: \$25, Week 11: \$15, Week 12: \$20, Week 13: \$24, Week 14: \$16, Week 15: \$16, Week 16: \$16, Week 17: \$19, Week 18: \$15, Week 19: \$20.

4. **Backlogging Costs**: If demand cannot be met in a given week, the unmet demand is backlogged to the next week, incurring a cost per backlogged unit. These costs are:
   - Week 1: \$55, Week 2: \$54, Week 3: \$71, Week 4: \$58, Week 5: \$51, Week 6: \$55, Week 7: \$45, Week 8: \$52, Week 9: \$60, Week 10: \$52, Week 11: \$52, Week 12: \$52, Week 13: \$76, Week 14: \$50, Week 15: \$47, Week 16: \$66, Week 17: \$70, Week 18: \$48, Week 19: \$69.

#### **Demand Constraints:**
- The demand for each week must be met either by the inventory on hand, the units ordered in that week, or by backlogging to the next week. The demand for each week is as follows:
  - Week 1: 495 units, Week 2: 316 units, Week 3: 375 units, Week 4: 467 units, Week 5: 418 units, Week 6: 398 units, Week 7: 533 units, Week 8: 525 units, Week 9: 361 units, Week 10: 452 units, Week 11: 470 units, Week 12: 378 units, Week 13: 302 units, Week 14: 463 units, Week 15: 438 units, Week 16: 383 units, Week 17: 377 units, Week 18: 429 units, Week 19: 324 units.

#### **Inventory and Backlogging Rules:**
- The inventory at the start of Week 1 and the end of Week 19 must be zero.
- The backlogged demand at the start of Week 1 and the end of Week 19 must also be zero.
- The amount ordered in any week cannot exceed the total demand over the 19-week period (7,904 units) if an order is placed in that week.

#### **Objective:**
Your task is to determine the optimal ordering schedule, inventory levels, and backlogged amounts for each week to minimize the total cost, which includes fixed ordering costs, variable ordering costs, inventory holding costs, and backlogging costs.

#### **Key Decisions:**
1. **Order Placement**: Decide whether to place an order in each week (a binary decision: yes or no).
2. **Order Quantity**: Determine the number of units to order in each week.
3. **Inventory Levels**: Decide how much inventory to hold at the end of each week.
4. **Backlogged Demand**: Determine the amount of unmet demand to backlog to the next week.

By carefully balancing these decisions, you aim to minimize the total cost while ensuring that all customer demand is met either immediately or through backlogging.","\[

You are managing the inventory and ordering process for a retail supply chain over a 19-week period. Your goal is to minimize the total costs associated with ordering, holding inventory, and backlogging unmet demand, while ensuring that customer demand is met as efficiently as possible. The costs and constraints are as follows:

#### **Cost Components:**
1. **Ordering Costs**: Each time an order is placed in a given week, a fixed cost is incurred. These costs vary by week and are as follows:
   - Week 1: \$930, Week 2: \$881, Week 3: \$925, Week 4: \$808, Week 5: \$711, Week 6: \$785, Week 7: \$997, Week 8: \$820, Week 9: \$843, Week 10: \$631, Week 11: \$726, Week 12: \$1,071, Week 13: \$741, Week 14: \$1,157, Week 15: \$916, Week 16: \$791, Week 17: \$1,055, Week 18: \$932, Week 19: \$794.

2. **Variable Ordering Costs**: In addition to the fixed costs, there is a variable cost per unit ordered in each week. These costs are:
   - Week 1: \$40, Week 2: \$26, Week 3: \$38, Week 4: \$20, Week 5: \$25, Week 6: \$22, Week 7: \$40, Week 8: \$39, Week 9: \$25, Week 10: \$26, Week 11: \$34, Week 12: \$25, Week 13: \$26, Week 14: \$27, Week 15: \$27, Week 16: \$35, Week 17: \$23, Week 18: \$26, Week 19: \$36.

3. **Inventory Holding Costs**: Holding inventory at the end of each week incurs a cost per unit. These costs are:
   - Week 1: \$19, Week 2: \$16, Week 3: \$24, Week 4: \$23, Week 5: \$24, Week 6: \$23, Week 7: \$20, Week 8: \$21, Week 9: \$21, Week 10: \$25, Week 11: \$15, Week 12: \$20, Week 13: \$24, Week 14: \$16, Week 15: \$16, Week 16: \$16, Week 17: \$19, Week 18: \$15, Week 19: \$20.

4. **Backlogging Costs**: If demand cannot be met in a given week, the unmet demand is backlogged to the next week, incurring a cost per backlogged unit. These costs are:
   - Week 1: \$55, Week 2: \$54, Week 3: \$71, Week 4: \$58, Week 5: \$51, Week 6: \$55, Week 7: \$45, Week 8: \$52, Week 9: \$60, Week 10: \$52, Week 11: \$52, Week 12: \$52, Week 13: \$76, Week 14: \$50, Week 15: \$47, Week 16: \$66, Week 17: \$70, Week 18: \$48, Week 19: \$69.

#### **Demand Constraints:**
- The demand for each week must be met either by the inventory on hand, the units ordered in that week, or by backlogging to the next week. The demand for each week is as follows:
  - Week 1: 495 units, Week 2: 316 units, Week 3: 375 units, Week 4: 467 units, Week 5: 418 units, Week 6: 398 units, Week 7: 533 units, Week 8: 525 units, Week 9: 361 units, Week 10: 452 units, Week 11: 470 units, Week 12: 378 units, Week 13: 302 units, Week 14: 463 units, Week 15: 438 units, Week 16: 383 units, Week 17: 377 units, Week 18: 429 units, Week 19: 324 units.

#### **Inventory and Backlogging Rules:**
- The inventory at the start of Week 1 and the end of Week 19 must be zero.
- The backlogged demand at the start of Week 1 and the end of Week 19 must also be zero.
- The amount ordered in any week cannot exceed the total demand over the 19-week period (7,904 units) if an order is placed in that week.

#### **Objective:**
Your task is to determine the optimal ordering schedule, inventory levels, and backlogged amounts for each week to minimize the total cost, which includes fixed ordering costs, variable ordering costs, inventory holding costs, and backlogging costs.

#### **Key Decisions:**
1. **Order Placement**: Decide whether to place an order in each week (a binary decision: yes or no).
2. **Order Quantity**: Determine the number of units to order in each week.
3. **Inventory Levels**: Decide how much inventory to hold at the end of each week.
4. **Backlogged Demand**: Determine the amount of unmet demand to backlog to the next week.

71,"The problem involves assigning employees to shifts across two restaurants to minimize costs associated with unfulfilled positions and employee assignments. There are two restaurants, each with two shifts per day, and eight employees available for assignment. Each shift at each restaurant has specific staffing demands for a particular skill, and employees have varying availability and skill sets. Employees can only be assigned to shifts they are available for and to roles that match their skills. Each employee can be assigned to at most one shift across all restaurants.

73," Facility Dispersion in a Network

You are tasked with selecting a set of facilities from a network of five locations (Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, and Node 4) to maximize the overall dispersion between the selected facilities. Dispersion is measured by the pairwise distances between the facilities, and your goal is to ensure that the selected facilities are as spread out as possible.

#### Key Decisions:
1. **Facility Selection**: You must choose exactly 2 facilities out of the 5 available locations. Each location can either be selected (1) or not selected (0).
2. **Pairwise Dispersion Activation**: For every pair of facilities, a binary decision determines whether both facilities in the pair are selected. This ensures that dispersion is only calculated for pairs where both facilities are chosen.

#### Objective:
Maximize the total dispersion across all selected facility pairs. The dispersion values between the facilities are as follows:
- Node 0 and Node 1: 24 units
- Node 0 and Node 2: 25 units
- Node 0 and Node 3: 18 units
- Node 0 and Node 4: 24 units
- Node 1 and Node 0: 22 units
- Node 1 and Node 2: 17 units
- Node 1 and Node 3: 22 units
- Node 1 and Node 4: 24 units
- Node 2 and Node 0: 18 units
- Node 2 and Node 1: 19 units
- Node 2 and Node 3: 25 units
- Node 2 and Node 4: 20 units
- Node 3 and Node 0: 16 units
- Node 3 and Node 1: 22 units
- Node 3 and Node 2: 16 units
- Node 3 and Node 4: 17 units
- Node 4 and Node 0: 22 units
- Node 4 and Node 1: 21 units
- Node 4 and Node 2: 19 units
- Node 4 and Node 3: 16 units

#### Constraints:
1. **Facility Selection Limit**: Exactly 2 facilities must be selected from the 5 available locations.
2. **Pairwise Activation Rules**:
   - For any pair of facilities, the pairwise dispersion can only be counted if both facilities in the pair are selected.
   - If either facility in a pair is not selected, the pairwise dispersion for that pair cannot be counted.
   - If both facilities in a pair are selected, the pairwise dispersion must be counted.

#### Numerical Parameters:
- Total facilities to select: 2
- Dispersion values between facilities are explicitly provided in the objective section above.

#### Goal:
Determine which 2 facilities to select and which pairwise dispersions to activate to maximize the total dispersion across the network while adhering to the constraints.","\[

2. **Pairwise Dispersion Activation**: For every pair of facilities, a binary decision determines whether both facilities in the pair are selected. This ensures that dispersion is only calculated for pairs where both facilities are chosen.

#### Objective:
Maximize the total dispersion across all selected facility pairs. The dispersion values between the facilities are as follows:
- Node 0 and Node 1: 24 units
- Node 0 and Node 2: 25 units
- Node 0 and Node 3: 18 units
- Node 0 and Node 4: 24 units
- Node 1 and Node 0: 22 units
- Node 1 and Node 2: 17 units
- Node 1 and Node 3: 22 units
- Node 1 and Node 4: 24 units
- Node 2 and Node 0: 18 units
- Node 2 and Node 1: 19 units
- Node 2 and Node 3: 25 units
- Node 2 and Node 4: 20 units
- Node 3 and Node 0: 16 units
- Node 3 and Node 1: 22 units
- Node 3 and Node 2: 16 units
- Node 3 and Node 4: 17 units
- Node 4 and Node 0: 22 units
- Node 4 and Node 1: 21 units
- Node 4 and Node 2: 19 units
- Node 4 and Node 3: 16 units

#### Constraints:
1. **Facility Selection Limit**: Exactly 2 facilities must be selected from the 5 available locations.
2. **Pairwise Activation Rules**:
   - For any pair of facilities, the pairwise dispersion can only be counted if both facilities in the pair are selected.
   - If either facility in a pair is not selected, the pairwise dispersion for that pair cannot be counted.
   - If both facilities in a pair are selected, the pairwise dispersion must be counted.

#### Numerical Parameters:
- Total facilities to select: 2
- Dispersion values between facilities are explicitly provided in the objective section above.

#### Goal:
Determine which 2 facilities to select and which pairwise dispersions to activate to maximize the total dispersion across the network while adhering to the constraints.",46,1

The setup cost is **136.4441474007699** per production run, and the startup cost is **72.08169936581939** per startup.

The production system involves three items (Item 0, Item 1, and Item 2), two machines (Machine 0 and Machine 1), and three time periods (Period 0, Period 1, and Period 2). For each item, machine, and time period, decide whether to produce the item (binary decision) and how much to produce (continuous decision). Determine whether to start up a machine for a specific item in a given period (binary decision). Decide how much inventory to carry over or how much demand to backlog for each item in each period (continuous decisions).

The total production, inventory, and backlog must balance the demand for each item in each period. For example, in Period 0, the demand for Item 0 is **15.13481645049243**, for Item 1 is **15.96509719647714**, and for Item 2 is **15.05799468831989**. In Period 1, the demand for Item 0 is **23.22348134905647**, for Item 1 is **24.89682877145792**, and for Item 2 is **20.28924491987942**. In Period 2, the demand for Item 0 is **19.81696900208589**, for Item 1 is **22.4702270586731**, and for Item 2 is **18.30123580755789**.

The production quantity and startup time must not exceed the machine's capacity. Machine 0 has a capacity of **74.37564803880434**, and starting it up requires **6.598818345230923** units of time. Machine 1 has a capacity of **61.80119129480688**, and starting it up requires **6.132700881798776** units of time. Each machine can produce only one item at a time in any given period. For example, in Period 0, Machine 0 can produce either Item 0, Item 1, or Item 2, but not more than one. Similarly, Machine 1 can produce only one item at a time in any period.

If a machine is used to produce an item in a period after being idle in the previous period, a startup cost is incurred. For example, if Machine 0 is used to produce Item 0 in Period 1 but was not used in Period 0, a startup cost of **72.08169936581939** is incurred. Production quantities, inventory levels, and backlogs must be non-negative. Production and startup decisions are binary (either 0 or 1).

The goal is to determine the optimal production, startup, inventory, and backlog decisions for each item, machine, and time period to minimize the total cost while satisfying all constraints.","\[

In Period 1, the demand for Item 0 is **23.22348134905647**, for Item 1 is **24.89682877145792**, and for Item 2 is **20.28924491987942**. In Period 2, the demand for Item 0 is **19.81696900208589**, for Item 1 is **22.4702270586731**, and for Item 2 is **18.30123580755789**.

The production quantity and startup time must not exceed the machine's capacity. Machine 0 has a capacity of **74.37564803880434**, and starting it up requires **6.598818345230923** units of time. Machine 1 has a capacity of **61.80119129480688**, and starting it up requires **6.132700881798776** units of time. Each machine can produce only one item at a time in any given period. For example, in Period 0, Machine 0 can produce either Item 0, Item 1, or Item 2, but not more than one. Similarly, Machine 1 can produce only one item at a time in any period.

If a machine is used to produce an item in a period after being idle in the previous period, a startup cost is incurred. For example, if Machine 0 is used to produce Item 0 in Period 1 but was not used in Period 0, a startup cost of **72.08169936581939** is incurred. Production quantities, inventory levels, and backlogs must be non-negative. Production and startup decisions are binary (either 0 or 1).

The goal is to determine the optimal production, startup, inventory, and backlog decisions for each item, machine, and time period to minimize the total cost while satisfying all constraints.",889.137272,0
76,"In a manufacturing facility, six distinct jobs labeled Job 0 to Job 5 need to be processed on a set of machines. Each job consists of two operations that must be performed in a specific order, with each operation assigned to a specific machine. The goal is to schedule these operations to minimize the total completion time, known as the makespan, ensuring all jobs are completed as quickly as possible.

Each operation has a processing time of 1 unit. For each job, the second operation cannot start until the first operation is completed. For example, Operation 1 of Job 0 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 0 is finished, and this applies to all jobs.

If two operations are assigned to the same machine, they cannot overlap in time. The order in which they are processed is determined by a binary decision variable. For example, if Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 1 of Job 4 are assigned to the same machine, one must be scheduled before the other. The binary variable X_(0,1)_(4,1) determines the order: if X_(0,1)_(4,1) is 1, then Operation 1 of Job 0 is scheduled before Operation 1 of Job 4; if it is 0, then Operation 1 of Job 4 is scheduled before Operation 1 of Job 0. This logic applies to all pairs of operations on shared machines.

The total completion time, C_max, must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, C_max must be greater than or equal to the completion time of Operation 0 of Job 0, which is S_(0,0) plus 1 unit. This applies to all operations across all jobs.

The start time of every operation must be non-negative. For example, S_(0,0) must be greater than or equal to 0, and this applies to all operations.

The binary variables X_(j,i)_(k,l) are used to enforce the order of operations on shared machines and can only take values of 0 or 1.

The objective is to minimize the makespan, C_max, which represents the total time required to complete all jobs. This ensures that the manufacturing process is as efficient as possible, reducing idle time and maximizing throughput. All processing times are 1 unit, and the makespan must be at least 1 unit greater than the completion time of every operation.","\[

83,"Cell Tower Coverage Planning

You are tasked with planning the deployment of cell towers across a region to maximize population coverage while adhering to a strict budget constraint. The region is divided into 30 distinct areas, each with a specific population size that needs to be served. Your goal is to determine which cell towers to build and which areas to cover, ensuring that the total cost of building the towers does not exceed the available budget.

#### Key Decisions:
1. **Build or Not Build a Tower**: For each of the 25 potential cell tower locations, you must decide whether to build the tower (a binary decision: build or not build).
2. **Coverage of Areas**: For each of the 30 areas, you must determine whether it will be covered by at least one of the built towers (a binary decision: covered or not covered).

#### Objective:
Maximize the total population covered by the deployed cell towers. The population sizes for the 30 areas are as follows:
- Area 0: 2,882 people
- Area 1: 4,926 people
- Area 2: 3,930 people
- Area 3: 3,468 people
- Area 4: 3,415 people
- Area 5: 2,697 people
- Area 6: 2,746 people
- Area 7: 3,817 people
- Area 8: 4,806 people
- Area 9: 2,889 people
- Area 10: 2,276 people
- Area 11: 2,087 people

- Area 26: 4,498 people
- Area 27: 3,423 people
- Area 28: 2,832 people
- Area 29: 3,064 people

#### Constraints:
1. **Coverage Requirements**:
   - Each area must be covered by at least one of the built towers. For example:
     - Area 0 can be covered by towers 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18, or 20.
     - Area 1 can be covered by towers 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 13, 15, 16, 20, 23, or 24.
     - Similar coverage constraints apply to all 30 areas, with specific combinations of towers required for each area.

2. **Budget Constraint**:
   - The total cost of building the selected towers must not exceed the available budget of 2,501 units. The costs for building each tower are as follows:
     - Tower 0: 453 units
     - Tower 1: 208 units
     - Tower 2: 223 units
     - Tower 3: 336 units
     - Tower 4: 473 units
     - Tower 5: 274 units
     - Tower 6: 257 units
     - Tower 7: 436 units
     - Tower 8: 440 units
     - Tower 9: 242 units
     - Tower 10: 272 units

     - Tower 16: 475 units
     - Tower 17: 238 units
     - Tower 18: 440 units
     - Tower 19: 496 units
     - Tower 20: 275 units
     - Tower 21: 240 units
     - Tower 22: 291 units
     - Tower 23: 320 units
     - Tower 24: 462 units

3. **Binary Decisions**:
   - Each tower can either be built (1) or not built (0).
   - Each area can either be covered (1) or not covered (0).

#### Summary:
Your task is to select which towers to build and which areas to cover, ensuring that the total population covered is maximized while staying within the budget. The coverage of each area depends on the specific combination of towers built, and the total cost of building the selected towers must not exceed 2,501 units.","\[

#### Objective:
Your task is to determine the optimal amount of supplies to ship between cities to meet all demands and surpluses while minimizing the total transportation cost. The shipments must respect the capacity limits of each route, and no negative shipments are allowed.

#### Constraints:
1. **Flow Balance**: For each city, the total amount of supplies shipped into the city must equal the total amount shipped out, adjusted for the city's supply or demand.
2. **Capacity Limits**: The amount of supplies shipped on any route cannot exceed the maximum capacity for that route.
3. **Non-Negativity**: All shipments must be non-negative.

By solving this problem, you will ensure that all cities receive the necessary medical supplies at the lowest possible transportation cost.","\[

Each city has a specific supply or demand for these supplies, and your goal is to ensure that all cities receive the necessary resources while minimizing the total transportation cost. The transportation network connects these cities, and each route has a specific cost per unit of supply shipped, as well as a maximum capacity limit.

#### Cities and Their Supply/Demand:
- **City 0** has a net demand of **34 units** (it needs 34 more units than it currently has).

85,"You are managing the landing schedule for six aircraft at a busy airport. Each aircraft has a target landing time, but due to operational constraints, the actual landing time may vary. Your goal is to minimize the total penalty costs associated with landing aircraft either earlier or later than their target times, while ensuring safe separation between consecutive landings.

Aircraft 0 has a target landing time of 86 units, can land as early as 60 units or as late as 100 units, and incurs a penalty of 12 units per time unit for landing early and 20 units per time unit for landing late. Aircraft 1 has a target landing time of 60 units, can land as early as 60 units or as late as 90 units, and incurs a penalty of 13 units per time unit for landing early and 16 units per time unit for landing late. Aircraft 2 has a target landing time of 71 units, can land as early as 60 units or as late as 100 units, and incurs a penalty of 16 units per time unit for landing early and 15 units per time unit for landing late. Aircraft 3 has a target landing time of 97 units, can land as early as 67 units or as late as 100 units, and incurs a penalty of 14 units per time unit for landing early and 13 units per time unit for landing late. Aircraft 4 has a target landing time of 89 units, can land as early as 60 units or as late as 100 units, and incurs a penalty of 15 units per time unit for landing early and 18 units per time unit for landing late. Aircraft 5 has a target landing time of 74 units, can land as early as 60 units or as late as 100 units, and incurs a penalty of 14 units per time unit for landing early and 19 units per time unit for landing late.

To ensure safety, there must be a minimum separation time between the landings of any two aircraft. If Aircraft 0 lands before Aircraft 1, there must be at least 7 units of separation. If Aircraft 1 lands before Aircraft 0, the separation must be at least 5 units. If Aircraft 0 lands before Aircraft 2, there must be at least 7 units of separation. If Aircraft 2 lands before Aircraft 0, the separation must be at least 5 units. If Aircraft 0 lands before Aircraft 3, there must be at least 5 units of separation. If Aircraft 3 lands before Aircraft 0, the separation must be at least 8 units. If Aircraft 0 lands before Aircraft 4, there must be at least 5 units of separation. If Aircraft 4 lands before Aircraft 0, the separation must be at least 7 units. If Aircraft 0 lands before Aircraft 5, there must be at least 5 units of separation. If Aircraft 5 lands before Aircraft 0, the separation must be at least 7 units. If Aircraft 1 lands before Aircraft 2, there must be at least 7 units of separation. If Aircraft 2 lands before Aircraft 1, the separation must be at least 8 units. If Aircraft 1 lands before Aircraft 3, there must be at least 5 units of separation. If Aircraft 3 lands before Aircraft 1, the separation must be at least 8 units. If Aircraft 1 lands before Aircraft 4, there must be at least 8 units of separation. If Aircraft 4 lands before Aircraft 1, the separation must be at least 7 units. If Aircraft 1 lands before Aircraft 5, there must be at least 7 units of separation. If Aircraft 5 lands before Aircraft 1, the separation must be at least 5 units. If Aircraft 2 lands before Aircraft 3, there must be at least 8 units of separation. If Aircraft 3 lands before Aircraft 2, the separation must be at least 8 units. If Aircraft 2 lands before Aircraft 4, there must be at least 8 units of separation. If Aircraft 4 lands before Aircraft 2, the separation must be at least 6 units. If Aircraft 2 lands before Aircraft 5, there must be at least 6 units of separation. If Aircraft 5 lands before Aircraft 2, the separation must be at least 8 units. If Aircraft 3 lands before Aircraft 4, there must be at least 6 units of separation. If Aircraft 4 lands before Aircraft 3, the separation must be at least 8 units. If Aircraft 3 lands before Aircraft 5, there must be at least 5 units of separation. If Aircraft 5 lands before Aircraft 3, the separation must be at least 7 units. If Aircraft 4 lands before Aircraft 5, there must be at least 6 units of separation. If Aircraft 5 lands before Aircraft 4, the separation must be at least 7 units.

Your task is to determine the actual landing times for all six aircraft such that each aircraft lands within its allowed time window, the separation requirements between consecutive landings are satisfied, and the total penalty cost, which is the sum of the penalties for landing early or late for all aircraft, is minimized. For each pair of aircraft, one must land before the other, and the separation time must be respected. The landing time for each aircraft must fall within its specified earliest and latest landing times. The penalties for landing early or late are calculated based on the difference between the actual landing time and the target landing time.","\[

To ensure safety, there must be a minimum separation time between the landings of any two aircraft. If Aircraft 0 lands before Aircraft 1, there must be at least 7 units of separation.

If Aircraft 5 lands before Aircraft 4, the separation must be at least 7 units.

Your task is to determine the actual landing times for all six aircraft such that each aircraft lands within its allowed time window, the separation requirements between consecutive landings are satisfied, and the total penalty cost, which is the sum of the penalties for landing early or late for all aircraft, is minimized. For each pair of aircraft, one must land before the other, and the separation time must be respected. The landing time for each aircraft must fall within its specified earliest and latest landing times. The penalties for landing early or late are calculated based on the difference between the actual landing time and the target landing time.",72,0
86,"In a manufacturing facility, six jobs labeled Job 0 through Job 5 must be scheduled, each consisting of two operations. The goal is to minimize the total production time (makespan), ensuring all jobs are completed efficiently. Each operation has a processing time of 1 unit of time. Operations within the same job must follow a sequence: the second operation cannot start until the first operation is completed. For example, Operation (0,1) of Job 0 cannot start until Operation (0,0) of Job 0 is finished, and this applies to all jobs.

Certain operations share the same machine and cannot overlap in time. The machine assignments are inferred from the constraints, which specify pairwise relationships between operations. For example, Operation (0,0) of Job 0 and Operation (3,0) of Job 3 must be scheduled on the same machine without overlapping, and similarly for other operation pairs. The order of operations on shared machines is determined by binary decision variables. For instance, if Operation (0,0) of Job 0 is scheduled before Operation (3,0) of Job 3 on a shared machine, the corresponding binary variable is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0.

The total production time (makespan) must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, if Operation (0,0) of Job 0 finishes at time 1 and Operation (0,1) of Job 0 finishes at time 2, the makespan must be at least 2. Similarly, if Operation (5,1) of Job 5 finishes at time 10, the makespan must be at least 10.

To enforce the constraints, a large constant \( N = 100,000 \) is used in the machine capacity constraints to ensure that operations sharing the same machine do not overlap. The start times of all operations are continuous variables, and the binary variables determine the order of operations on shared machines. The objective is to minimize the makespan while respecting the precedence constraints within jobs, the machine capacity constraints, and the non-negativity and binary constraints on the decision variables.","\[

87,"Cell Tower Coverage Planning

You are tasked with planning the deployment of cell towers across a region to maximize population coverage while adhering to a strict budget constraint. The region is divided into 32 distinct areas, each with a specific population size that needs to be covered by cell tower signals. Your goal is to determine which cell towers to build and which areas to cover, ensuring that the total cost of building the towers does not exceed the available budget.

#### Key Details:
1. **Population Coverage**: Each area has a specific population size that can be covered if a cell tower is built in a location that serves that area. The populations of the areas range from 2,010 to 4,970 people, with the total population across all areas being a critical factor in your decision-making.

2. **Cell Tower Options**: There are 29 potential cell tower locations, each with a unique construction cost. The costs range from 210 units for Tower 1 to 498 units for Tower 6. Building a tower at any of these locations will enable coverage for specific areas, depending on the tower's range and location.

3. **Coverage Requirements**: For an area to be considered covered, at least one of the cell towers that can serve it must be built. For example, Area 0 can be covered if any of Towers 0, 2, 5, 6, 11, 18, 20, 21, 26, or 27 are built. Similar coverage relationships exist for all 32 areas.

4. **Budget Constraint**: The total cost of building the selected cell towers must not exceed 3,226 units. This budget must be carefully allocated to maximize population coverage while staying within the financial limit.

5. **Decision Variables**:
   - **Build Decisions**: For each of the 29 cell tower locations, you must decide whether to build the tower (yes or no).
   - **Coverage Decisions**: For each of the 32 areas, you must determine whether it will be covered (yes or no), based on the towers built.

#### Objective:
Your primary objective is to maximize the total population covered by the cell towers. This means selecting a combination of towers to build that ensures the largest possible number of people across the 32 areas have access to cell service, while staying within the budget.

#### Constraints:
1. **Coverage Logic**: An area can only be considered covered if at least one of the cell towers capable of serving it is built. For example, Area 1 can only be covered if at least one of Towers 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 20, 23, or 28 is built.

2. **Budget Limit**: The total cost of building the selected towers must not exceed 3,226 units. This requires careful selection of towers to balance coverage and cost.

3. **Binary Decisions**: Both the decision to build a tower and the decision to cover an area are binary (yes or no). You cannot partially build a tower or partially cover an area.

#### Numerical Parameters:
- **Population Sizes**: The populations of the 32 areas are as follows:
  - Area 0: 2,285
  - Area 1: 3,023
  - Area 2: 3,557
  - Area 3: 3,938
  - Area 4: 3,689
  - Area 5: 2,426
  - Area 6: 4,697
  - Area 7: 3,214
  - Area 8: 2,580
  - Area 9: 2,010
  - Area 10: 3,180
  - Area 11: 4,083
  - Area 12: 2,787
  - Area 13: 3,095
  - Area 14: 2,898
  - Area 15: 4,374
  - Area 16: 4,970
  - Area 17: 3,689
  - Area 18: 4,612
  - Area 19: 3,232
  - Area 20: 4,177
  - Area 21: 2,211
  - Area 22: 3,123
  - Area 23: 4,194
  - Area 24: 3,774
  - Area 25: 3,391
  - Area 26: 3,959
  - Area 27: 3,010
  - Area 28: 3,213
  - Area 29: 3,106
  - Area 30: 2,652
  - Area 31: 3,441

- **Tower Costs**: The construction costs for the 29 towers are as follows:
  - Tower 0: 323 units
  - Tower 1: 210 units
  - Tower 2: 360 units
  - Tower 3: 480 units
  - Tower 4: 375 units
  - Tower 5: 491 units
  - Tower 6: 498 units
  - Tower 7: 267 units
  - Tower 8: 413 units
  - Tower 9: 417 units
  - Tower 10: 291 units
  - Tower 11: 388 units
  - Tower 12: 284 units
  - Tower 13: 463 units
  - Tower 14: 309 units
  - Tower 15: 382 units
  - Tower 16: 476 units
  - Tower 17: 325 units
  - Tower 18: 428 units
  - Tower 19: 265 units
  - Tower 20: 323 units
  - Tower 21: 282 units
  - Tower 22: 441 units
  - Tower 23: 467 units
  - Tower 24: 491 units
  - Tower 25: 232 units
  - Tower 26: 396 units
  - Tower 27: 370 units
  - Tower 28: 309 units

#### Summary:
Your task is to select which cell towers to build and which areas to cover, ensuring that the total population covered is maximized while staying within the budget of 3,226 units. The decisions must respect the coverage requirements for each area and the binary nature of the build and coverage decisions.","\[

# Solve
m.optimize()",3655,,"Cell Tower Coverage Planning

You are tasked with planning the deployment of cell towers across a region to maximize population coverage while adhering to a strict budget constraint. The region is divided into 32 distinct areas, each with a specific population size that needs to be covered by cell tower signals. Your goal is to determine which cell towers to build and which areas to cover, ensuring that the total cost of building the towers does not exceed the available budget.

#### Key Details:
1. **Population Coverage**: Each area has a specific population size that can be covered if a cell tower is built in a location that serves that area. The populations of the areas range from 2,010 to 4,970 people, with the total population across all areas being a critical factor in your decision-making.

2. **Cell Tower Options**: There are 29 potential cell tower locations, each with a unique construction cost. The costs range from 210 units for Tower 1 to 498 units for Tower 6. Building a tower at any of these locations will enable coverage for specific areas, depending on the tower's range and location.

3. **Coverage Requirements**: For an area to be considered covered, at least one of the cell towers that can serve it must be built. For example, Area 0 can be covered if any of Towers 0, 2, 5, 6, 11, 18, 20, 21, 26, or 27 are built. Similar coverage relationships exist for all 32 areas.

4. **Budget Constraint**: The total cost of building the selected cell towers must not exceed 3,226 units. This budget must be carefully allocated to maximize population coverage while staying within the financial limit.

5. **Decision Variables**:
   - **Build Decisions**: For each of the 29 cell tower locations, you must decide whether to build the tower (yes or no).
   - **Coverage Decisions**: For each of the 32 areas, you must determine whether it will be covered (yes or no), based on the towers built.

#### Objective:
Your primary objective is to maximize the total population covered by the cell towers. This means selecting a combination of towers to build that ensures the largest possible number of people across the 32 areas have access to cell service, while staying within the budget.

#### Constraints:
1. **Coverage Logic**: An area can only be considered covered if at least one of the cell towers capable of serving it is built. For example, Area 1 can only be covered if at least one of Towers 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 20, 23, or 28 is built.

2. **Budget Limit**: The total cost of building the selected towers must not exceed 3,226 units. This requires careful selection of towers to balance coverage and cost.

3. **Binary Decisions**: Both the decision to build a tower and the decision to cover an area are binary (yes or no). You cannot partially build a tower or partially cover an area.

#### Numerical Parameters:
- **Population Sizes**: The populations of the 32 areas are as follows:
  - Area 0: 2,285
  - Area 1: 3,023
  - Area 2: 3,557
  - Area 3: 3,938
  - Area 4: 3,689
  - Area 5: 2,426
  - Area 6: 4,697
  - Area 7: 3,214
  - Area 8: 2,580
  - Area 9: 2,010
  - Area 10: 3,180
  - Area 11: 4,083
  - Area 12: 2,787
  - Area 13: 3,095
  - Area 14: 2,898
  - Area 15: 4,374
  - Area 16: 4,970
  - Area 17: 3,689
  - Area 18: 4,612
  - Area 19: 3,232
  - Area 20: 4,177
  - Area 21: 2,211
  - Area 22: 3,123

  - Area 24: 3,774
  - Area 25: 3,391
  - Area 26: 3,959
  - Area 27: 3,010
  - Area 28: 3,213
  - Area 29: 3,106
  - Area 30: 2,652
  - Area 31: 3,441

- **Tower Costs**: The construction costs for the 29 towers are as follows:
  - Tower 0: 323 units
  - Tower 1: 210 units
  - Tower 2: 360 units
  - Tower 3: 480 units
  - Tower 4: 375 units
  - Tower 5: 491 units
  - Tower 6: 498 units
  - Tower 7: 267 units
  - Tower 8: 413 units
  - Tower 9: 417 units
  - Tower 10: 291 units
  - Tower 11: 388 units
  - Tower 12: 284 units
  - Tower 13: 463 units
  - Tower 14: 309 units
  - Tower 15: 382 units
  - Tower 16: 476 units
  - Tower 17: 325 units
  - Tower 18: 428 units
  - Tower 19: 265 units
  - Tower 20: 323 units
  - Tower 21: 282 units
  - Tower 22: 441 units
  - Tower 23: 467 units
  - Tower 24: 491 units
  - Tower 25: 232 units
  - Tower 26: 396 units
  - Tower 27: 370 units
  - Tower 28: 309 units

#### Summary:
Your task is to select which cell towers to build and which areas to cover, ensuring that the total population covered is maximized while staying within the budget of 3,226 units. The decisions must respect the coverage requirements for each area and the binary nature of the build and coverage decisions.",108590,0

89," Facility Dispersion in a Network of Locations

Imagine you are tasked with selecting a subset of facilities to open across a network of five locations (Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, and Node 4) to maximize the overall dispersion between the selected facilities. Dispersion is measured by the pairwise distances between the facilities, and your goal is to ensure that the selected facilities are as spread out as possible to optimize coverage and minimize redundancy.

#### Key Details:
1. **Facility Selection**: You must select exactly **2 facilities** to open from the five available locations. Each location can either be chosen (1) or not chosen (0) to host a facility.
2. **Dispersion Values**: The pairwise distances (dispersion values) between the locations are as follows:
   - Node 0 and Node 1: 20 units
   - Node 0 and Node 2: 20 units
   - Node 0 and Node 3: 18 units
   - Node 0 and Node 4: 18 units
   - Node 1 and Node 0: 22 units
   - Node 1 and Node 2: 21 units
   - Node 1 and Node 3: 16 units
   - Node 1 and Node 4: 17 units
   - Node 2 and Node 0: 16 units
   - Node 2 and Node 1: 23 units
   - Node 2 and Node 3: 15 units
   - Node 2 and Node 4: 24 units
   - Node 3 and Node 0: 23 units
   - Node 3 and Node 1: 16 units
   - Node 3 and Node 2: 23 units
   - Node 3 and Node 4: 20 units
   - Node 4 and Node 0: 19 units
   - Node 4 and Node 1: 21 units
   - Node 4 and Node 2: 15 units
   - Node 4 and Node 3: 25 units

3. **Objective**: Maximize the total dispersion between the selected facilities. This means you want to choose the two facilities such that the sum of their pairwise distances is as large as possible.

4. **Constraints**:
   - **Selection Constraint**: Exactly two facilities must be selected from the five locations.
   - **Pairwise Activation**: For any two locations, the pairwise dispersion value is only counted if both locations are selected. For example, the dispersion between Node 0 and Node 1 (20 units) is only included in the total if both Node 0 and Node 1 are chosen.
   - **Logical Relationships**: If a location is not selected, no pairwise dispersion involving that location can be included in the total.

#### Example:
If you select Node 0 and Node 1, the total dispersion would be 20 units (from Node 0 to Node 1). If you select Node 2 and Node 4, the total dispersion would be 24 units (from Node 2 to Node 4). Your goal is to find the pair of locations that yields the highest possible total dispersion.

#### Decision to Make:
- Which two facilities to open from the five available locations to maximize the total pairwise dispersion.

#### Numerical Parameters:
- All pairwise dispersion values are provided above.
- The total number of facilities to select is fixed at 2.

This problem requires balancing the selection of facilities to ensure they are as dispersed as possible, while adhering to the constraint of selecting exactly two locations. The solution will provide the optimal pair of facilities to open, maximizing the overall dispersion across the network.","\[

The decision variables include binary choices for selecting each location and binary variables for selecting pairs of locations. The objective is to maximize the minimum distance (MinDistance) between any two selected facilities. Exactly two facilities must be selected. For each pair of locations, if both are selected, the distance between them must be at least MinDistance. If either or both locations in a pair are not selected, the distance constraint is relaxed using a large constant (1,000,000). The pairwise selection variables are symmetric, meaning selecting Node i and Node j is the same as selecting Node j and Node i. Additionally, the pairwise selection variables for the same node (e.g., Node 0 and Node 0) are set to 0. The distances between locations are as follows: Node 0 and Node 1 (41 units), Node 0 and Node 2 (31 units), Node 0 and Node 3 (43 units), Node 0 and Node 4 (10 units), Node 1 and Node 2 (34 units), Node 1 and Node 3 (46 units), Node 1 and Node 4 (12 units), Node 2 and Node 3 (41 units), Node 2 and Node 4 (24 units), and Node 3 and Node 4 (23 units).

91,"Managing Resource Distribution Across Cities

You are responsible for managing the distribution of a critical resource (e.g., medical supplies, food, or energy) across eight interconnected cities. Each city has a specific supply or demand for the resource, and your goal is to ensure that all cities receive the required amount while minimizing the total transportation cost. The transportation costs vary depending on the routes between cities, and each route has a maximum capacity limit for resource shipments.

#### City Requirements:
- **City 0** has a surplus of 51 units of the resource.
- **City 1** requires an additional 2 units to meet its demand.
- **City 2** requires an additional 7 units.
- **City 3** requires an additional 11 units.
- **City 4** requires an additional 9 units.
- **City 5** requires an additional 25 units.
- **City 6** has a surplus of 19 units.

92,"The problem involves assigning employees to shifts across two restaurants to meet specific skill demands while minimizing costs. There are seven employees, each with specific availability and skill capabilities. Each shift at each restaurant requires one employee with Skill 0. Assigning an employee to a shift incurs a cost: some assignments cost 1 unit, while others cost 3 units. If a shift cannot be filled, a penalty of 100 units is incurred per unfulfilled position.

Employees are only available for certain shifts, as specified by the availability constraints. For example, Employee 0 is available for Shift 0 but not for Shift 1 at Restaurant 1, and Employee 1 is available for Shift 0 but not for Shift 1 at Restaurant 1. Employees can only be assigned to roles that match their skills, and each employee can be assigned to at most one shift across all restaurants and roles. The total number of employees assigned to a shift plus any unfulfilled positions must equal the demand for that shift.

The objective is to minimize the total cost, which includes the cost of assigning employees to roles based on their preferences and the penalty cost for any unfulfilled positions. The preference costs for assignments range from 1 to 3 units, and the penalty cost for unfulfilled positions is 100 units each. The demand for each shift is one employee with the required skill.","\[

m.optimize()",204,,"The problem involves assigning employees to shifts across two restaurants to meet specific skill demands while minimizing costs. There are seven employees, each with specific availability and skill capabilities. Each shift at each restaurant requires one employee with Skill 0. Assigning an employee to a shift incurs a cost: some assignments cost 1 unit, while others cost 3 units. If a shift cannot be filled, a penalty of 100 units is incurred per unfulfilled position.

Employees are only available for certain shifts, as specified by the availability constraints. For example, Employee 0 is available for Shift 0 but not for Shift 1 at Restaurant 1, and Employee 1 is available for Shift 0 but not for Shift 1 at Restaurant 1. Employees can only be assigned to roles that match their skills, and each employee can be assigned to at most one shift across all restaurants and roles. The total number of employees assigned to a shift plus any unfulfilled positions must equal the demand for that shift.

The objective is to minimize the total cost, which includes the cost of assigning employees to roles based on their preferences and the penalty cost for any unfulfilled positions. The preference costs for assignments range from 1 to 3 units, and the penalty cost for unfulfilled positions is 100 units each. The demand for each shift is one employee with the required skill.",4,0

94,"You are tasked with optimizing the deployment of cell towers across a region to maximize population coverage while adhering to a strict budget constraint. The region is divided into 35 distinct areas, each with a specific population size that needs to be covered by the cell towers. The goal is to determine which towers to build and which areas to cover to ensure the maximum number of people have access to cellular service.

#### Key Decisions:
1. **Build or Not Build**: For each of the 29 potential tower locations, you must decide whether to build the tower (a binary decision: build or not build).
2. **Coverage**: For each of the 35 regions, you must determine whether it will be covered by at least one of the built towers (a binary decision: covered or not covered).

#### Objective:
Maximize the total population covered by the deployed cell towers. The population sizes for each region are as follows:
- Region 0: 2,328 people
- Region 1: 2,364 people
- Region 2: 2,101 people
- Region 3: 4,451 people
- Region 4: 4,175 people

#### Constraints:
1. **Coverage Requirement**: For a region to be considered covered, at least one of the towers that can serve it must be built. The specific towers that can cover each region are listed in the problem data. For example:
   - Region 0 can be covered by towers 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 15, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, or 28.

   - Similar constraints apply to all 35 regions.

2. **Budget Constraint**: The total cost of building the selected towers must not exceed the available budget of 2,968 units. The cost of building each tower is as follows:
   - Tower 0: 476 units
   - Tower 1: 388 units
   - Tower 2: 444 units
   - Tower 3: 230 units
   - Tower 4: 449 units

98,"Facility Dispersion in a Network

Imagine you are tasked with selecting a set of facilities to maximize their dispersion across a network of five locations (nodes). The goal is to ensure that the selected facilities are as spread out as possible, which is measured by the pairwise distances between them. You must select exactly two facilities out of the five available locations.

Each pair of locations has a specific distance value associated with it, representing how far apart they are. These distances are as follows:

- Distance between Node 0 and Node 1: 24 units  
- Distance between Node 0 and Node 2: 22 units  
- Distance between Node 0 and Node 3: 23 units  
- Distance between Node 0 and Node 4: 21 units  
- Distance between Node 1 and Node 0: 20 units  
- Distance between Node 1 and Node 2: 19 units  
- Distance between Node 1 and Node 3: 19 units  
- Distance between Node 1 and Node 4: 25 units  
- Distance between Node 2 and Node 0: 17 units  
- Distance between Node 2 and Node 1: 20 units  
- Distance between Node 2 and Node 3: 18 units  
- Distance between Node 2 and Node 4: 20 units  
- Distance between Node 3 and Node 0: 25 units  
- Distance between Node 3 and Node 1: 18 units  
- Distance between Node 3 and Node 2: 21 units  
- Distance between Node 3 and Node 4: 24 units  
- Distance between Node 4 and Node 0: 21 units  
- Distance between Node 4 and Node 1: 18 units  
- Distance between Node 4 and Node 2: 15 units  
- Distance between Node 4 and Node 3: 23 units  

Your objective is to maximize the total dispersion, which is the sum of the distances between all pairs of selected facilities. However, there are specific rules governing the selection process:

Imagine you are tasked with selecting a set of facilities to maximize their dispersion across a network of five locations (nodes). The goal is to ensure that the selected facilities are as spread out as possible, which is measured by the pairwise distances between them. You must select exactly two facilities out of the five available locations.

Each pair of locations has a specific distance value associated with it, representing how far apart they are. These distances are as follows:

- Distance between Node 0 and Node 1: 24 units  
- Distance between Node 0 and Node 2: 22 units  
- Distance between Node 0 and Node 3: 23 units  
- Distance between Node 0 and Node 4: 21 units  
- Distance between Node 1 and Node 0: 20 units  
- Distance between Node 1 and Node 2: 19 units  
- Distance between Node 1 and Node 3: 19 units  
- Distance between Node 1 and Node 4: 25 units  
- Distance between Node 2 and Node 0: 17 units  
- Distance between Node 2 and Node 1: 20 units  
- Distance between Node 2 and Node 3: 18 units  
- Distance between Node 2 and Node 4: 20 units  
- Distance between Node 3 and Node 0: 25 units  
- Distance between Node 3 and Node 1: 18 units  
- Distance between Node 3 and Node 2: 21 units  
- Distance between Node 3 and Node 4: 24 units  
- Distance between Node 4 and Node 0: 21 units  
- Distance between Node 4 and Node 1: 18 units  
- Distance between Node 4 and Node 2: 15 units  
- Distance between Node 4 and Node 3: 23 units  

Your objective is to maximize the total dispersion, which is the sum of the distances between all pairs of selected facilities. However, there are specific rules governing the selection process:

1. **Selection Constraint**: Exactly two facilities must be selected from the five available locations.  
2. **Pairwise Activation**: A distance between two locations is only counted if both locations are selected as facilities. For example, the distance between Node 0 and Node 1 (24 units) is only included in the total dispersion if both Node 0 and Node 1 are chosen.  
3. **Logical Consistency**: If a pair of locations is selected, the distance between them must be fully accounted for in the total dispersion. Conversely, if either location in a pair is not selected, the distance between them must not contribute to the total dispersion.  

Your task is to determine which two locations to select as facilities to maximize the total dispersion while adhering to the constraints above. The solution must ensure that the selection of facilities is logically consistent and that the total dispersion is calculated accurately based on the pairwise distances provided.",48,0
99,"There are 5 jobs, each consisting of 2 operations that must be performed in sequence. Each operation has a processing time of 1 unit of time. Operations are assigned to machines, and each machine can process only one operation at a time. The goal is to minimize the total completion time (makespan) of all jobs by determining the start times of each operation and the order in which operations are processed on the machines.

For each job, the second operation cannot start until the first operation has been completed. For example, Operation 1 of Job 0 must start at least 1 unit of time after Operation 0 of Job 0 starts. This applies to all jobs. Operations assigned to the same machine cannot overlap in time. For every pair of operations on the same machine, one must be processed before the other. If Operation A is processed before Operation B, then Operation B must start at least 1 unit of time after Operation A completes. Conversely, if Operation B is processed before Operation A, then Operation A must start at least 1 unit of time after Operation B completes. These constraints apply to all relevant pairs of operations.

The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, the makespan must be at least 1 unit of time after the start of Operation 0 of Job 0, and this applies to all operations across all jobs. All start times must be non-negative, and the order variables, which determine the sequence of operations on the machines, must be binary (0 or 1). A large constant (100,000) is used in the constraints to ensure the correct order of operations is enforced. The objective is to minimize the makespan, ensuring all operations are scheduled efficiently without violating the constraints.","\[

100," Facility Dispersion in a Network of Locations

You are tasked with selecting a subset of facilities to open across a network of five locations (Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, and Node 4) to maximize the overall dispersion between the selected facilities. Dispersion is measured by the pairwise distances between the facilities, with higher distances indicating better dispersion. The goal is to ensure that the selected facilities are as spread out as possible within the network.

#### Key Decisions:
1. **Facility Selection**: You must decide which facilities to open. Specifically, you need to select exactly 2 out of the 5 available locations to open facilities. Each location can either be selected (1) or not selected (0).
2. **Pairwise Dispersion Activation**: For each pair of selected facilities, you must determine whether their dispersion contributes to the overall objective. This is represented by a binary decision variable that activates only if both facilities in the pair are selected.

#### Objective:
Maximize the total dispersion across all pairs of selected facilities. The dispersion values between each pair of locations are as follows:
- Node 0 and Node 1: 18 units
- Node 0 and Node 2: 24 units
- Node 0 and Node 3: 21 units
- Node 0 and Node 4: 24 units
- Node 1 and Node 0: 17 units
- Node 1 and Node 2: 21 units
- Node 1 and Node 3: 21 units
- Node 1 and Node 4: 17 units
- Node 2 and Node 0: 19 units
- Node 2 and Node 1: 15 units
- Node 2 and Node 3: 19 units
- Node 2 and Node 4: 22 units
- Node 3 and Node 0: 15 units
- Node 3 and Node 1: 17 units
- Node 3 and Node 2: 22 units
- Node 3 and Node 4: 16 units
- Node 4 and Node 0: 25 units
- Node 4 and Node 1: 24 units
- Node 4 and Node 2: 16 units
- Node 4 and Node 3: 23 units

The objective is to maximize the sum of these dispersion values for all pairs of selected facilities.

#### Constraints:
1. **Facility Selection Limit**: Exactly 2 facilities must be selected out of the 5 available locations. This ensures that the solution is neither too sparse nor too dense.
2. **Pairwise Dispersion Activation Rules**:
   - For any pair of locations, their dispersion can only contribute to the objective if both facilities in the pair are selected.
   - If either facility in a pair is not selected, their dispersion cannot be counted.
   - If both facilities in a pair are selected, their dispersion must be counted.

#### Numerical Parameters:
- The number of facilities to select: 2.
- The dispersion values between each pair of locations are explicitly provided above.

#### Summary:
Your task is to select 2 out of 5 locations to open facilities such that the total dispersion between the selected facilities is maximized. The dispersion values between each pair of locations are given, and the solution must adhere to the constraints on facility selection and pairwise dispersion activation. The goal is to ensure that the selected facilities are as spread out as possible within the network.","\[

101,"You are managing a factory that produces three types of products: **product_0**, **product_1**, and **product_2**, over a five-period planning horizon. The factory operates with three types of machines: **grinders**, **drills**, and **borers**, each with specific capacities and maintenance schedules. Your goal is to maximize the factory's profit by optimizing production, inventory, and sales decisions while adhering to operational constraints.

The profit per unit sold is **$249** for **product_0**, **$222** for **product_1**, and **$249** for **product_2**. The holding cost for each unit in inventory is **$15** per period.

In the first period, the production of each product must equal the sum of its sales and inventory for that period. For subsequent periods, the inventory from the previous period plus the current production must equal the sum of current sales and inventory.

Each unit of **product_0** requires **2 hours** on grinders, **2 hours** on drills, and **1 hour** on borers. Each unit of **product_1** requires **1 hour** on grinders, **2 hours** on drills, and **1 hour** on borers. Each unit of **product_2** requires **1 hour** on grinders, **2 hours** on drills, and **2 hours** on borers.

The total available grine it is **0 hours**.

The maximum inventory capacity for each product is **80 units** per period. The maximum number of units that can be sold for each product in each period is as follows: **product_0**: **63** (period 0), **68** (period 1), **42** (period 2), **58** (period 3), **54** (period 4); **product_1**: **53** (period 0), **62** (period 1), **67** (period 2), **46** (period 3), **56** (period 4); **product_2**: **64** (period 0), **67** (period 1), **65** (period 2), **65** (period 3), **58** (period 4).

At the end of the planning horizon (period 4), the inventory for each product must be exactly **20 units**. All production, inventory, and sales quantities must be non-negative. Machine downtime for maintenance is accounted for in the capacity constraints.

m.optimize()",212544,,"You are managing a factory that produces three types of products: **product_0**, **product_1**, and **product_2**, over a five-period planning horizon. The factory operates with three types of machines: **grinders**, **drills**, and **borers**, each with specific capacities and maintenance schedules. Your goal is to maximize the factory's profit by optimizing production, inventory, and sales decisions while adhering to operational constraints.

The profit per unit sold is **$249** for **product_0**, **$222** for **product_1**, and **$249** for **product_2**. The holding cost for each unit in inventory is **$15** per period.

In the first period, the production of each product must equal the sum of its sales and inventory for that period. For subsequent periods, the inventory from the previous period plus the current production must equal the sum of current sales and inventory.

Each unit of **product_0** requires **2 hours** on grinders, **2 hours** on drills, and **1 hour** on borers. Each unit of **product_1** requires **1 hour** on grinders, **2 hours** on drills, and **1 hour** on borers. Each unit of **product_2** requires **1 hour** on grinders, **2 hours** on drills, and **2 hours** on borers.

The total available grine it is **0 hours**.

The maximum inventory capacity for each product is **80 units** per period. The maximum number of units that can be sold for each product in each period is as follows: **product_0**: **63** (period 0), **68** (period 1), **42** (period 2), **58** (period 3), **54** (period 4); **product_1**: **53** (period 0), **62** (period 1), **67** (period 2), **46** (period 3), **56** (period 4); **product_2**: **64** (period 0), **67** (period 1), **65** (period 2), **65** (period 3), **58** (period 4).

At the end of the planning horizon (period 4), the inventory for each product must be exactly **20 units**. All production, inventory, and sales quantities must be non-negative. Machine downtime for maintenance is accounted for in the capacity constraints.

The region is divided into 32 distinct areas, each with a specific population size that needs to be served. Your goal is to determine which cell towers to build and which areas to cover, ensuring that the total cost of building the towers does not exceed the available budget.

#### Key Decisions:
1. **Build or Not Build**: For each of the 30 potential cell tower locations, you must decide whether to build the tower (yes or no). Building a tower incurs a specific cost, which varies by location.
2. **Coverage Assignment**: For each of the 32 areas, you must determine whether it will be covered by at least one of the built towers (yes or no). An area is considered covered if at least one of the towers that can serve it is built.

#### Objective:
Maximize the total population covered by the deployed cell towers. The population sizes for the 32 areas are as follows:
- Area 0: 4,657
- Area 1: 4,663
- Area 2: 3,139

#### Constraints:
1. **Coverage Requirements**: Each area must be covered by at least one of the built towers. The specific towers that can cover each area are listed below:
   - Area 0 can be covered by Towers 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, or 28.

103,"In a manufacturing facility, you are tasked with scheduling a set of jobs across multiple machines to minimize the total completion time, known as the makespan. Each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be performed in a specific order, and each operation is assigned to a particular machine. The goal is to determine the start times for each operation on its assigned machine while respecting the following constraints:

Each job has a predefined sequence of operations. For example, Job 0 has two operations: Operation 0 must be completed before Operation 1 can begin. Similarly, Job 1 has Operation 0 and Operation 1, with Operation 0 preceding Operation 1. This pattern applies to all jobs, ensuring that no operation starts before its predecessor in the same job has finished. Specifically, for Job 0, Operation 1 cannot start until Operation 0 has been completed, and for Job 1, Operation 1 cannot start until Operation 0 has been completed. This logic applies to all jobs, ensuring the correct sequence of operations.

Each machine can process only one operation at a time. To prevent overlapping, the start times of operations assigned to the same machine must be carefully scheduled. For example, if Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 1 are assigned to the same machine, they cannot overlap. A binary decision variable determines the order in which these operations are processed. If Operation 0 of Job 0 is scheduled first, Operation 0 of Job 1 must start only after Operation 0 of Job 0 has finished, and vice versa. Similar constraints apply to all pairs of operations assigned to the same machine, ensuring no two operations overlap. A large constant (100,000) is used in the constraints to enforce the order of operations on shared machines.

The makespan is defined as the total time required to complete all jobs. It must be at least as large as the completion time of the last operation across all jobs. For example, if Operation 1 of Job 6 finishes at time 100, the makespan must be at least 100. This ensures that the makespan accurately reflects the total time needed to complete all operations.

The start time of every operation must be non-negative, meaning no operation can start before time zero. Binary variables are used to determine the order of operations on shared machines. These variables can only take values of 0 or 1, representing the scheduling decisions. The processing time for each operation is implicitly defined by the constraints. For example, the precedence constraints specify that Operation 1 of Job 0 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 0 has been completed, with a required gap of at least 1 time unit. The binary variables determine the order of operations on shared machines. For instance, if the binary variable for Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 1 is 1, Operation 0 of Job 0 is scheduled before Operation 0 of Job 1 on the same machine. The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, if Operation 0 of Job 0 finishes at time 10, the makespan must be at least 10.

The objective is to minimize the makespan, ensuring that all jobs are completed in the shortest possible time while respecting the precedence and machine capacity constraints. This problem requires determining the optimal start times for all operations and the sequence of operations on shared machines to achieve the minimum total completion time.","\[

Similar constraints apply to all pairs of operations assigned to the same machine, ensuring no two operations overlap. A large constant (100,000) is used in the constraints to enforce the order of operations on shared machines.

The makespan is defined as the total time required to complete all jobs. It must be at least as large as the completion time of the last operation across all jobs. For example, if Operation 1 of Job 6 finishes at time 100, the makespan must be at least 100. This ensures that the makespan accurately reflects the total time needed to complete all operations.

The start time of every operation must be non-negative, meaning no operation can start before time zero. Binary variables are used to determine the order of operations on shared machines. These variables can only take values of 0 or 1, representing the scheduling decisions. The processing time for each operation is implicitly defined by the constraints. For example, the precedence constraints specify that Operation 1 of Job 0 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 0 has been completed, with a required gap of at least 1 time unit. The binary variables determine the order of operations on shared machines. For instance, if the binary variable for Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 1 is 1, Operation 0 of Job 0 is scheduled before Operation 0 of Job 1 on the same machine. The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, if Operation 0 of Job 0 finishes at time 10, the makespan must be at least 10.

The objective is to minimize the makespan, ensuring that all jobs are completed in the shortest possible time while respecting the precedence and machine capacity constraints. This problem requires determining the optimal start times for all operations and the sequence of operations on shared machines to achieve the minimum total completion time.",3,0

The facility has a limited number of machines, and some operations from different jobs must be performed on the same machine. To avoid conflicts, no two operations can be scheduled on the same machine at the same time. A binary decision variable determines the order in which these operations are scheduled. For example, if Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 3 are assigned to the same machine, the binary variable ensures that one operation starts at least 1 unit of time after the other. Within each job, operations must be performed in the specified order. For instance, Operation 1 of Job 0 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 0 has been completed.

#### Objective:
Your goal is to determine the optimal flow of resources between cities to meet all supply and demand requirements while minimizing the total transportation cost. Ensure that the flow on each route does not exceed its capacity and that all resource flows are non-negative.

This problem requires balancing the flow of resources across the network of cities, respecting the capacity limits of each route, and achieving the lowest possible transportation cost.",709,0
107,"Minimize the total operational cost, which includes the base cost of operating generators, the variable cost based on power output, and the startup cost for generators. The base cost is 80 units per generator per period for Type 0 and Type 2 generators, and 78 units for Type 1 generators. The variable cost is 4 units per MW for Type 0 and Type 1 generators, and 3 units per MW for Type 2 generators. The startup cost is 353 units for Type 0 generators, 349 units for Type 1 generators, and 351 units for Type 2 generators.

The total power output from all generators must meet or exceed the demand in each period, which is 163 MW in Period 0, 180 MW in Period 1, 208 MW in Period 2, 183 MW in Period 3, and 227 MW in Period 4. Each generator type has a minimum and maximum power output per generator: Type 0 generators must produce at least 35 MW and at most 126 MW, Type 1 generators must produce at least 35 MW and at most 130 MW, and Type 2 generators must produce at least 35 MW and at most 125 MW.

The total maximum possible output from all generators must be at least 15% higher than the demand in each period. For example, in Period 0, the total maximum output must be at least 187.45 MW. The number of generators operating in each period cannot exceed the available capacity: up to 5 Type 0 generators, 2 Type 1 generators, and 1 Type 2 generator can be operated in any period.

The number of generators started in a period is limited by the change in the number of generators operating from the previous period to the current period. For example, in Period 1, the number of Type 0 generators started cannot exceed the difference between the number of Type 0 generators operating in Period 1 and Period 0. This rule applies similarly for Type 1 and Type 2 generators across all periods.

The goal is to determine the optimal number of generators to operate, the power output for each generator type, and the number of generators to start in each period to minimize the total operational cost while meeting all constraints.","\[

- **Job 0**: 5 hours on Machine 0, 8 hours on Machine 1, 8 hours on Machine 2, and 5 hours on Machine 3.
- **Job 1**: 7 hours on Machine 0, 6 hours on Machine 1, 7 hours on Machine 2, and 5 hours on Machine 3.

2. **One Schedule Position per Job**: Each job must be assigned to exactly one schedule position. No job can be assigned to multiple positions.

3. **Machine Precedence**: The processing of a job on Machine 1 cannot start until it has completed processing on Machine 0. Similarly, processing on Machine 2 cannot begin until the job has finished on Machine 1, and processing on Machine 3 cannot start until the job has completed on Machine 2.

4. **Job Precedence**: The processing of a job in a later schedule position cannot start on any machine until the job in the previous position has completed its processing on that machine. For example, if Job 0 is in Position 0 and Job 1 is in Position 1, Job 1 cannot start on Machine 0 until Job 0 has finished its processing on Machine 0.

The objective is to determine the optimal schedule for processing the six jobs across the four machines to minimize the total production time, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied.

109,"The problem involves scheduling the landing times of five aircraft to minimize the total penalty costs associated with deviations from their target landing times while ensuring safe separation between landings and adhering to time windows. Each aircraft has a target landing time, earliest and latest possible landing times, and penalty costs for landing early or late. The aircraft details are as follows: Aircraft 0 has a target landing time of 83 minutes, earliest landing time of 60 minutes, latest landing time of 100 minutes, early penalty cost of \$16 per minute, and late penalty cost of \$16 per minute. Aircraft 1 has a target landing time of 79 minutes, earliest landing time of 60 minutes, latest landing time of 100 minutes, early penalty cost of \$16 per minute, and late penalty cost of \$10 per minute. Aircraft 2 has a target landing time of 75 minutes, earliest landing time of 60 minutes, latest landing time of 100 minutes, early penalty cost of \$16 per minute, and late penalty cost of \$13 per minute. Aircraft 3 has a target landing time of 95 minutes, earliest landing time of 65 minutes, latest landing time of 100 minutes, early penalty cost of \$19 per minute, and late penalty cost of \$19 per minute. Aircraft 4 has a target landing time of 98 minutes, earliest landing time of 68 minutes, latest landing time of 100 minutes, early penalty cost of \$14 per minute, and late penalty cost of \$15 per minute.

To ensure safety, the following minimum separation times must be maintained between landings: 5 minutes between Aircraft 0 and Aircraft 1, 5 minutes between Aircraft 0 and Aircraft 2, 5 minutes between Aircraft 0 and Aircraft 3, 5 minutes between Aircraft 0 and Aircraft 4, 7 minutes between Aircraft 1 and Aircraft 2, 7 minutes between Aircraft 1 and Aircraft 3, 5 minutes between Aircraft 1 and Aircraft 4, 6 minutes between Aircraft 2 and Aircraft 3, 7 minutes between Aircraft 2 and Aircraft 4, and 5 minutes between Aircraft 3 and Aircraft 4.

The landing times of each aircraft must fall within their specified earliest and latest possible landing times. The separation constraints must be respected, meaning that the landing times of any two aircraft must maintain the required separation based on their order of landing. The penalty for landing early is calculated as the number of minutes early multiplied by the early penalty cost, and the penalty for landing late is calculated as the number of minutes late multiplied by the late penalty cost. The objective is to determine the landing times for all five aircraft such that the total penalty cost is minimized, and all separation requirements and landing time windows are strictly adhered to.

Each aircraft has a target landing time, earliest and latest possible landing times, and penalty costs for landing early or late. The aircraft details are as follows: Aircraft 0 has a target landing time of 83 minutes, earliest landing time of 60 minutes, latest landing time of 100 minutes, early penalty cost of \$16 per minute, and late penalty cost of \$16 per minute. Aircraft 1 has a target landing time of 79 minutes, earliest landing time of 60 minutes, latest landing time of 100 minutes, early penalty cost of \$16 per minute, and late penalty cost of \$10 per minute. Aircraft 2 has a target landing time of 75 minutes, earliest landing time of 60 minutes, latest landing time of 100 minutes, early penalty cost of \$16 per minute, and late penalty cost of \$13 per minute. Aircraft 3 has a target landing time of 95 minutes, earliest landing time of 65 minutes, latest landing time of 100 minutes, early penalty cost of \$19 per minute, and late penalty cost of \$19 per minute. Aircraft 4 has a target landing time of 98 minutes, earliest landing time of 68 minutes, latest landing time of 100 minutes, early penalty cost of \$14 per minute, and late penalty cost of \$15 per minute.

To ensure safety, the following minimum separation times must be maintained between landings: 5 minutes between Aircraft 0 and Aircraft 1, 5 minutes between Aircraft 0 and Aircraft 2, 5 minutes between Aircraft 0 and Aircraft 3, 5 minutes between Aircraft 0 and Aircraft 4, 7 minutes between Aircraft 1 and Aircraft 2, 7 minutes between Aircraft 1 and Aircraft 3, 5 minutes between Aircraft 1 and Aircraft 4, 6 minutes between Aircraft 2 and Aircraft 3, 7 minutes between Aircraft 2 and Aircraft 4, and 5 minutes between Aircraft 3 and Aircraft 4.

The landing times of each aircraft must fall within their specified earliest and latest possible landing times. The separation constraints must be respected, meaning that the landing times of any two aircraft must maintain the required separation based on their order of landing. The penalty for landing early is calculated as the number of minutes early multiplied by the early penalty cost, and the penalty for landing late is calculated as the number of minutes late multiplied by the late penalty cost. The objective is to determine the landing times for all five aircraft such that the total penalty cost is minimized, and all separation requirements and landing time windows are strictly adhered to. This involves deciding the exact landing time for each aircraft and the order in which they land, ensuring that the schedule is both safe and cost-effective.",94,1

112,"Imagine you are managing a power generation system responsible for supplying electricity to a region over five distinct periods. The system consists of three types of power generators, each with unique operational characteristics and costs. Your goal is to determine the optimal number of generators to operate, the amount of power each generator should produce, and when to start up additional generators to meet the region's electricity demand at the lowest possible cost.

#### Key Decisions:
1. **Number of Generators to Operate**: For each generator type (Type 0, Type 1, Type 2) and each period (Period 0 to Period 4), decide how many generators should be active.
2. **Power Output**: Determine the amount of power (in MW) each active generator should produce during each period.
3. **Generator Startups**: Decide whether to start up additional generators in each period, incurring a startup cost.

#### Objective:
Minimize the total cost of operating the power generation system, which includes:
- **Base Costs**: Each active generator incurs a fixed cost of 79 units per period, regardless of its power output.
- **Per-MW Costs**: Each generator also incurs a variable cost based on its power output: 3 units per MW for Type 0, 4 units per MW for Type 1, and 4 units per MW for Type 2.
- **Startup Costs**: Starting up a generator incurs a one-time cost of 355 units for Type 0 and 349 units for Types 1 and 2.

#### Constraints:
1. **Demand Satisfaction**: The total power output across all generators must meet or exceed the region's electricity demand in each period. The demands are:
   - Period 0: 167 MW
   - Period 1: 212 MW
   - Period 2: 224 MW
   - Period 3: 221 MW
   - Period 4: 189 MW

2. **Generator Capacity Limits**:
   - Each generator has a minimum and maximum power output:
     - Type 0: Minimum 35 MW, Maximum 128 MW
     - Type 1: Minimum 35 MW, Maximum 129 MW
     - Type 2: Minimum 35 MW, Maximum 125 MW
   - The power output of each generator must be within these limits based on whether it is active.

3. **Reserve Margin**: To ensure reliability, the total maximum possible power output across all generators must be at least 15% higher than the demand in each period. This translates to:
   - Period 0: 192.05 MW
   - Period 1: 243.8 MW
   - Period 2: 257.6 MW
   - Period 3: 254.15 MW
   - Period 4: 217.35 MW

4. **Generator Availability**:
   - The number of generators that can be active is limited:
     - Type 0: Maximum 1 generator per period
     - Type 1: Maximum 4 generators per period
     - Type 2: Maximum 3 generators per period

5. **Startup Logic**:
   - If a generator is started in a period, it must have been inactive in the previous period.
   - For Type 2 generators, up to 2 additional generators can be started in Period 0 without requiring a startup in the previous period.

#### Numerical Parameters:
- **Base Costs**: 79 units per active generator per period.
- **Per-MW Costs**: 3 units for Type 0, 4 units for Types 1 and 2.
- **Startup Costs**: 355 units for Type 0, 349 units for Types 1 and 2.
- **Demands**: 167 MW (Period 0), 212 MW (Period 1), 224 MW (Period 2), 221 MW (Period 3), 189 MW (Period 4).
- **Capacity Limits**: 
  - Type 0: 35 MW (min), 128 MW (max)
  - Type 1: 35 MW (min), 129 MW (max)
  - Type 2: 35 MW (min), 125 MW (max)
- **Reserve Margins**: 192.05 MW (Period 0), 243.8 MW (Period 1), 257.6 MW (Period 2), 254.15 MW (Period 3), 217.35 MW (Period 4).

Your task is to determine the optimal combination of active generators, their power outputs, and startup decisions to meet the region's electricity demand at the lowest total cost while adhering to all operational constraints.","\[

118," Inventory Management for a Retail Supply Chain

You are responsible for managing the inventory and ordering process for a retail supply chain over a 21-week period. The goal is to minimize the total costs associated with ordering and holding inventory while ensuring that customer demand is met each week. The costs include ordering costs, unit purchase costs, and inventory holding costs. Additionally, there are specific constraints on inventory levels and ordering decisions.

#### Key Decisions:
1. **Ordering Decisions**: Each week, you must decide whether to place an order (a binary decision) and, if so, how much to order. Placing an order incurs a fixed cost, and the amount ordered cannot exceed a certain limit based on the total demand over the 21-week period.
2. **Inventory Levels**: You must manage the ending inventory each week, ensuring that it meets the flow balance constraints (i.e., the inventory carried over from the previous week plus the amount ordered equals the ending inventory plus the demand for that week).

#### Objective:
Minimize the total cost, which includes:
- **Ordering Costs**: Fixed costs for placing an order in a given week. These costs vary by week and are as follows: 459 in week 1, 555 in week 2, 547 in week 3, 530 in week 4, 436 in week 5, 401 in week 6, 490 in week 7, 462 in week 8, 479 in week 9, 563 in week 10, 456 in week 11, 442 in week 12, 530 in week 13, 427 in week 14, 512 in week 15, 574 in week 16, 430 in week 17, 424 in week 18, 484 in week 19, 507 in week 20, and 446 in week 21.
- **Unit Purchase Costs**: Variable costs for each unit ordered. These costs also vary by week and are as follows: 49 in week 1, 48 in week 2, 55 in week 3, 44 in week 4, 51 in week 5, 48 in week 6, 53 in week 7, 43 in week 8, 42 in week 9, 52 in week 10, 45 in week 11, 42 in week 12, 43 in week 13, 42 in week 14, 59 in week 15, 57 in week 16, 57 in week 17, 44 in week 18, 57 in week 19, 60 in week 20, and 43 in week 21.
- **Holding Costs**: Costs for holding inventory at the end of each week. These costs are as follows: 23 in week 1, 28 in week 2, 28 in week 3, 25 in week 4, 30 in week 5, 25 in week 6, 28 in week 7, 22 in week 8, 30 in week 9, 30 in week 10, 23 in week 11, 28 in week 12, 27 in week 13, 22 in week 14, 22 in week 15, 23 in week 16, 20 in week 17, 28 in week 18, 30 in week 19, 30 in week 20, and 24 in week 21.

#### Constraints:
1. **Flow Balance**: The ending inventory for each week must satisfy the following relationship:
   - Ending inventory from the previous week + amount ordered = ending inventory for the current week + demand for the current week.
   - The demand for each week is as follows: 150 in week 1, 132 in week 2, 135 in week 3, 178 in week 4, 133 in week 5, 173 in week 6, 161 in week 7, 195 in week 8, 110 in week 9, 118 in week 10, 131 in week 11, 198 in week 12, 118 in week 13, 120 in week 14, 129 in week 15, 148 in week 16, 189 in week 17, 178 in week 18, 145 in week 19, 161 in week 20, and 155 in week 21.

2. **Ordering Limits**: The amount ordered in any week cannot exceed the total demand over the 21-week period (3157 units) if an order is placed. If no order is placed, the amount ordered must be zero.

3. **Starting and Ending Inventory**: The starting inventory at the beginning of week 1 is zero, and the ending inventory at the end of week 21 must also be zero.

#### Goal:
Your task is to determine the optimal ordering and inventory management plan that minimizes the total cost while meeting all constraints. This includes deciding when to place orders, how much to order each week, and how much inventory to carry over each week to meet demand without exceeding the budget or violating any constraints.","\[

119,"You are tasked with managing the distribution of resources across eight interconnected cities to ensure each city meets its specific demand while minimizing the total transportation cost. Each city has a unique supply of resources, a specific demand, and a limited capacity to handle incoming shipments. Additionally, the transportation links between cities have varying costs and capacity constraints.

City 0 has a net outflow of 5 units, meaning it is a supply node, and it can handle up to 13 units of incoming shipments. City 1 has a net inflow of 2 units, meaning it is a demand node, and it can accommodate up to 14 units of incoming shipments. City 2 is balanced, with no net demand or surplus, and can handle up to 17 units of incoming shipments. City 3 is also balanced, with no net demand or surplus, and can handle up to 12 units of incoming shipments. City 4 has a net outflow of 1 unit, meaning it is a supply node, and it can handle up to 16 units of incoming shipments. City 5 has a net inflow of 2 units, meaning it is a demand node, and it can accommodate up to 19 units of incoming shipments. City 6 is balanced, with no net demand or surplus, and can handle up to 16 units of incoming shipments.

Each city has a unique supply of resources, a specific demand, and a limited capacity to handle incoming shipments. Additionally, the transportation links between cities have varying costs and capacity constraints.

City 0 has a net outflow of 5 units, meaning it is a supply node, and it can handle up to 13 units of incoming shipments. City 1 has a net inflow of 2 units, meaning it is a demand node, and it can accommodate up to 14 units of incoming shipments. City 2 is balanced, with no net demand or surplus, and can handle up to 17 units of incoming shipments. City 3 is also balanced, with no net demand or surplus, and can handle up to 12 units of incoming shipments. City 4 has a net outflow of 1 unit, meaning it is a supply node, and it can handle up to 16 units of incoming shipments. City 5 has a net inflow of 2 units, meaning it is a demand node, and it can accommodate up to 19 units of incoming shipments. City 6 is balanced, with no net demand or surplus, and can handle up to 16 units of incoming shipments.

120,"The problem involves scheduling operations for five jobs (Job 0 through Job 4) in a manufacturing facility, where each job consists of two operations that must be performed in sequence. Each operation takes exactly 1 unit of time to complete. The facility has a limited number of machines, and multiple operations from different jobs may need to be assigned to the same machine. A machine can only handle one operation at a time, so the order of operations on shared machines must be determined to avoid overlaps. 

The goal is to minimize the total completion time, known as the makespan, which is the time at which the last operation across all jobs finishes. To achieve this, the start times of all operations must be scheduled such that: (1) for each job, the second operation starts only after the first operation is completed; (2) if two operations are assigned to the same machine, one must finish before the other starts; and (3) the makespan is at least as large as the completion time of every operation. 

The order of operations on shared machines is determined using binary decision variables, which indicate whether one operation is scheduled before another. A large constant (100000) is used in the constraints to enforce the sequencing of operations on shared machines.

Each city must be visited exactly once. The delivery vehicle must arrive at each city from exactly one other city and depart to exactly one other city. The delivery route must form a single tour, meaning the vehicle cannot split into smaller loops or subtours. To enforce this, each city is assigned a position in the tour, with positions ranging from 1 to 7, ensuring a valid sequence. The positions must follow a logical sequence without gaps or repetitions. The route between any two cities is binary: it is either included (1) or excluded (0) in the final tour.

The objective is to minimize the total transportation cost for the delivery route while satisfying all constraints. The solution must account for all the costs and constraints outlined above.",1987,0
125,"You are tasked with optimizing the placement of emergency response centers across a network of five critical locations (Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, and Node 4) to maximize the overall coverage and effectiveness of the response system. Each location has unique characteristics, and the goal is to select exactly three locations to establish these centers. The effectiveness of the system is measured by the combined coverage scores between the selected centers, which are determined by predefined pairwise scores representing the strategic importance of connecting each pair of locations.

#### Key Decisions:
1. **Selecting Locations**: You must choose exactly three out of the five locations to establish emergency response centers. Each location is represented by a binary decision: if a center is established at a location, it is selected (1); otherwise, it is not (0).
2. **Pairwise Coverage**: For each pair of selected locations, the coverage score is determined by the predefined pairwise importance values. These scores reflect the strategic benefit of having both locations in the network.

#### Objective:
Maximize the total coverage score across all pairs of selected locations. The coverage scores for each pair are as follows:
- Node 0 and Node 1: 24  
- Node 0 and Node 2: 21  
- Node 0 and Node 3: 16  
- Node 0 and Node 4: 15  
- Node 1 and Node 0: 21  
- Node 1 and Node 2: 19  
- Node 1 and Node 3: 24  
- Node 1 and Node 4: 23  
- Node 2 and Node 0: 21  
- Node 2 and Node 1: 17  
- Node 2 and Node 3: 25  
- Node 2 and Node 4: 19  
- Node 3 and Node 0: 18  
- Node 3 and Node 1: 24  
- Node 3 and Node 2: 17  
- Node 3 and Node 4: 17  
- Node 4 and Node 0: 15  
- Node 4 and Node 1: 18  
- Node 4 and Node 2: 15  
- Node 4 and Node 3: 24  

#### Constraints:
1. **Selection of Centers**: Exactly three locations must be selected to establish emergency response centers. This means the sum of selected locations must equal three.
2. **Pairwise Coverage Activation**: For any pair of locations, the coverage score is only counted if both locations in the pair are selected. This ensures that the coverage score is only applied to active pairs.
3. **Logical Relationships**:
   - If a location is not selected, no coverage scores involving that location can be counted.
   - If both locations in a pair are selected, the coverage score for that pair is fully counted.
   - If only one location in a pair is selected, the coverage score for that pair is not counted.

#### Numerical Parameters:
- The pairwise coverage scores are explicitly provided for all possible pairs of locations, as listed above.
- The total number of selected locations must be exactly three.

#### Summary:
Your task is to select three out of the five locations to establish emergency response centers such that the total coverage score, based on the predefined pairwise importance values, is maximized. The selection must adhere to the constraints ensuring that only active pairs of selected locations contribute to the coverage score.","\[

126,"The problem involves scheduling operations for 7 products, each requiring 2 operations to be performed in sequence. Each operation has a fixed processing time of 1 unit of time. The operations must be scheduled on shared machines, where each machine can handle only one operation at a time.

Machine capacity constraints ensure that no two operations on the same machine overlap in time. These constraints are enforced using binary variables that determine the order of operations on shared machines. A large constant (100000) is used in the machine capacity constraints to ensure that the constraints are satisfied when the binary variables determine the order of operations.

128,"The manufacturing facility produces seven distinct products (Jobs 0 through 6) using four specialized machines (Machine 0, Machine 1, Machine 2, and Machine 3). Each product must pass through all four machines in a specific sequence, and the goal is to schedule production to minimize the total completion time (makespan), ensuring all products are completed as quickly as possible. The objective is to minimize the sum of the start time of the last product on Machine 3 and the weighted completion times of specific jobs in the final position. Each product must be assigned to exactly one position in the production sequence on each machine, and each position on each machine can only be assigned to one product. The start time of a product on a machine cannot begin until the product has completed processing on the previous machine, and the start time of a product in a later position on a machine cannot begin until the product in the previous position has completed processing on that machine. Processing times for each product on each machine are as follows: Job 0 takes 10 units on Machine 0, 5 units on Machine 1, 5 units on Machine 2, and 7 units on Machine 3; Job 1 takes 6 units on Machine 0, 5 units on Machine 1, 10 units on Machine 2, and 9 units on Machine 3; Job 2 takes 9 units on Machine 0, 8 units on Machine 1, 6 units on Machine 2, and 9 units on Machine 3; Job 3 takes 6 units on Machine 0, 5 units on Machine 1, 9 units on Machine 2, and 6 units on Machine 3; Job 4 takes 5 units on Machine 0, 8 units on Machine 1, 5 units on Machine 2, and 5 units on Machine 3; Job 5 takes 9 units on Machine 0, 10 units on Machine 1, 5 units on Machine 2, and 10 units on Machine 3; Job 6 takes 7 units on Machine 0, 6 units on Machine 1, 10 units on Machine 2, and 5 units on Machine 3. The objective function includes weighted coefficients for specific jobs in the final position, such as 7 for Job 0 in position 6, 9 for Job 1 in position 6, 9 for Job 2 in position 6, 6 for Job 3 in position 6, 5 for Job 4 in position 6, 10 for Job 5 in position 6, and 5 for Job 6 in position 6. The constraints ensure that each job is assigned to exactly one position on each machine, each position on each machine is assigned to exactly one job, and the start times respect the precedence relationships between machines and positions. The variables include binary assignment variables for each job and position on each machine, and continuous start time variables for each position on each machine.

130,"Cell Tower Deployment for Regional Coverage

You are tasked with optimizing the deployment of cell towers across a region to maximize population coverage while adhering to a strict budget constraint. The region is divided into 33 distinct areas, each with a specific population size that needs to be served. Your goal is to determine which cell towers to build and which areas to cover to ensure the maximum number of people have access to cellular service.

#### Key Decisions:
1. **Which cell towers to build**: There are 29 potential cell tower locations, each with a unique construction cost. You must decide whether to build each tower (a binary decision: build or not build).
2. **Which areas to cover**: Each of the 33 areas can be either covered or not covered by the deployed cell towers. Coverage for an area is only possible if at least one of the cell towers that can serve it is built.

#### Objective:
Maximize the total population covered by the deployed cell towers. The population sizes for the 33 areas are as follows:
- Area 0: 3,522 people  
- Area 1: 2,492 people  
- Area 2: 2,865 people  
- Area 3: 2,596 people  
- Area 4: 2,194 people  
- Area 5: 4,001 people  
- Area 6: 3,027 people  
- Area 7: 2,581 people  
- Area 8: 4,848 people  
- Area 9: 2,814 people  
- Area 10: 3,543 people  
- Area 11: 2,234 people  
- Area 12: 2,960 people  
- Area 13: 4,297 people  
- Area 14: 2,792 people  
- Area 15: 4,520 people  
- Area 16: 2,685 people  
- Area 17: 2,022 people  
- Area 18: 4,858 people  
- Area 19: 4,814 people  
- Area 20: 3,432 people  
- Area 21: 3,730 people  
- Area 22: 2,526 people  
- Area 23: 3,277 people

- Area 29: 4,275 people  
- Area 30: 4,407 people  
- Area 31: 3,809 people  
- Area 32: 2,163 people  

#### Constraints:
1. **Coverage Requirements**: For an area to be considered covered, at least one of the cell towers that can serve it must be built. The specific combinations of cell towers that can cover each area are provided in the data. For example:
   - Area 0 can be covered if any of the following towers are built: Tower 3, Tower 5, Tower 7, Tower 10, Tower 11, Tower 13, Tower 15, Tower 17, Tower 19, Tower 22, Tower 23, Tower 26, Tower 27, or Tower 28.
   - Similar constraints apply to all 33 areas, with each area having a unique set of towers that can provide coverage.

2. **Budget Constraint**: The total cost of building the selected cell towers must not exceed the available budget of 3,059 units. The construction costs for the 29 towers are as follows:
   - Tower 0: 303 units  
   - Tower 1: 378 units  
   - Tower 2: 327 units  
   - Tower 3: 444 units  
   - Tower 4: 391 units  
   - Tower 5: 357 units  
   - Tower 6: 444 units  
   - Tower 7: 244 units  
   - Tower 8: 433 units  
   - Tower 9: 407 units  
   - Tower 10: 305 units  
   - Tower 11: 296 units  
   - Tower 12: 315 units  
   - Tower 13: 302 units  
   - Tower 14: 495 units  
   - Tower 15: 240 units  
   - Tower 16: 379 units  
   - Tower 17: 211 units  
   - Tower 18: 388 units  
   - Tower 19: 220 units  
   - Tower 20: 408 units  
   - Tower 21: 430 units  
   - Tower 22: 327 units  
   - Tower 23: 470 units  
   - Tower 24: 381 units

   - Tower 26: 215 units  
   - Tower 27: 239 units  
   - Tower 28: 372 units  

3. **Binary Decisions**: Each cell tower can either be built (1) or not built (0), and each area can either be covered (1) or not covered (0).

#### Summary:
Your task is to select a combination of cell towers to build, ensuring that the total cost does not exceed 3,059 units, while maximizing the total population covered across the 33 areas. The coverage for each area depends on the specific towers built, and the population sizes and tower costs are provided in detail.

132,"The goal is to determine the optimal allocation of resources for three products, Product A, Product B, and Product C, to effectively manage a logistics network. The decision variables include the quantities of each product, represented by \( x[0] \), \( x[1] \), and \( x[2] \), as well as auxiliary variables \( y_0[0] \) to \( y_0[3] \), \( y_1[0] \) to \( y_1[3] \), \( y_2[0] \) to \( y_2[3] \), and logistical thresholds \( t_0[0] \), \( t_1[0] \), and \( t_2[0] \). All variables are free to take any real value.

The objective is to minimize the total cost, which is calculated as the sum of the following contributions: -1.109620416617511 times Product A, -0.6560359731414873 times Product B, and -0.7019449433705992 times Product C. This objective reflects the cost structure of the logistics network.

Operational constraints must be satisfied, including three linear equality constraints that define exact relationships between the products. These constraints are: 0.973138297335475 times Product A plus 0.5753515721139748 times Product B minus 0.3345391015917421 times Product C equals -0.1751595502819031; 1.004855798779082 times Product A plus 1.155166374661675 times Product B minus 0.6908735867360416 times Product C equals -0.7437001018712311; and -2.110665713909855 times Product A plus 0.0465859108136975 times Product B plus 1.404349170472437 times Product C equals -2.786300004238841.

Additionally, there are 14 linear constraints that ensure the allocation of resources adheres to specific conditions. These constraints involve combinations of the product quantities and the auxiliary variables \( y_0 \), \( y_1 \), \( y_2 \), and the logistical thresholds \( t_0 \), \( t_1 \), and \( t_2 \). For example, one constraint states that 0.0366410572471413 times Product A plus 0.0568820534300137 times Product B minus 0.000079998 times Product C plus \( y_0[0] \) equals 0.0535813009430022. Similar constraints are defined for the remaining auxiliary variables and thresholds.

Furthermore, three second-order cone constraints ensure that the logistical thresholds satisfy specific quadratic relationships. These constraints are: the sum of the squares of \( y_0[0] \), \( y_0[1] \), \( y_0[2] \), and \( y_0[3] \) minus the square of \( t_0[0] \) must be less than or equal to zero; the sum of the squares of \( y_1[0] \), \( y_1[1] \), \( y_1[2] \), and \( y_1[3] \) minus the square of \( t_1[0] \) must be less than or equal to zero; and the sum of the squares of \( y_2[0] \), \( y_2[1] \), \( y_2[2] \), and \( y_2[3] \) minus the square of \( t_2[0] \) must be less than or equal to zero.

The task is to determine the optimal production and distribution levels for Products A, B, and C, along with the associated intermediate metrics and logistical thresholds, to minimize the total cost while satisfying all operational constraints.","\[

The problem includes five linear equality constraints. The first constraint requires 1.095257012774988 times the first variable plus 0.0405603467945054 times the second variable minus 0.4142813496378452 times the third variable plus 0.0769274791661522 times the fourth variable to equal -1.589822894954058.

Additionally, there are fifteen linear equality constraints involving intermediate variables. These constraints link the decision variables to intermediate variables \( y_0[0], y_0[1], y_1[0], y_1[1], y_2[0], y_2[1], y_3[0], y_3[1], y_4[0], y_4[1] \) and \( t_0[0], t_1[0], t_2[0], t_3[0], t_4[0] \). For example, the sixth constraint requires 0.0930293796109266 times the first variable plus 0.0314487985808588 times the second variable plus 0.0397727019597557 times the third variable plus 0.077024350952894 times the fourth variable plus \( y_0[0] \) to equal -0.0576022066753428. Similarly, the seventh constraint requires 0.3668170269095303 times the first variable plus 0.7382374711397578 times the second variable plus 1.389031691584004 times the third variable plus 0.4784897178942196 times the fourth variable plus \( t_0[0] \) to equal 0.5986251002407987. The remaining constraints follow a similar structure, connecting the decision variables to the intermediate variables with specific coefficients and right-hand side values.

The problem also includes five second-order cone constraints, each involving the intermediate variables. These constraints require that the negative square of \( t_0[0] \) plus the sum of the squares of \( y_0[0] \) and \( y_0[1] \) be less than or equal to zero. Similarly, the negative square of \( t_1[0] \) plus the sum of the squares of \( y_1[0] \) and \( y_1[1] \) must be less than or equal to zero, and this pattern continues for the remaining second-order cone constraints.

All variables, including the four decision variables and the intermediate variables, are free to take any real value. The goal is to determine the values of these variables that minimize the objective function while satisfying all the linear equality constraints and second-order cone constraints.","\[

The objective is to minimize the expression -1.901009736372913 times the first variable minus 0.7076764487261838 times the second variable plus 0.083088283352758 times the third variable plus 0.4134020176281016 times the fourth variable.

The problem includes five linear equality constraints. The first constraint requires 1.095257012774988 times the first variable plus 0.0405603467945054 times the second variable minus 0.4142813496378452 times the third variable plus 0.0769274791661522 times the fourth variable to equal -1.589822894954058. The second constraint requires 1.707274498669728 times the first variable minus 0.2477918751127619 times the second variable plus 1.014458021156339 times the third variable plus 0.0887060380647792 times the fourth variable to equal -1.412888255577238. The third constraint requires -0.1928047063342317 times the first variable plus 0.2495462876428885 times the second variable minus 1.347804555582835 times the third variable plus 0.5969103897857732 times the fourth variable to equal -0.7126523262327211. The fourth constraint requires 0.2539181754797121 times the first variable minus 0.4354680188894089 times the second variable minus 0.5625489084016247 times the third variable minus 0.2079253654505673 times the fourth variable to equal 0.0211399419876052. The fifth constraint requires 1.271683708095805 times the first variable plus 1.41227063919648 times the second variable plus 1.237138949722734 times the third variable plus 1.269794867507303 times the fourth variable to equal -3.001810041763422.

Additionally, there are fifteen linear equality constraints involving intermediate variables. These constraints link the decision variables to intermediate variables \( y_0[0], y_0[1], y_1[0], y_1[1], y_2[0], y_2[1], y_3[0], y_3[1], y_4[0], y_4[1] \) and \( t_0[0], t_1[0], t_2[0], t_3[0], t_4[0] \). For example, the sixth constraint requires 0.0930293796109266 times the first variable plus 0.0314487985808588 times the second variable plus 0.0397727019597557 times the third variable plus 0.077024350952894 times the fourth variable plus \( y_0[0] \) to equal -0.0576022066753428. Similarly, the seventh constraint requires 0.3668170269095303 times the first variable plus 0.7382374711397578 times the second variable plus 1.389031691584004 times the third variable plus 0.4784897178942196 times the fourth variable plus \( t_0[0] \) to equal 0.5986251002407987. The remaining constraints follow a similar structure, connecting the decision variables to the intermediate variables with specific coefficients and right-hand side values.

The problem also includes five second-order cone constraints, each involving the intermediate variables. These constraints require that the negative square of \( t_0[0] \) plus the sum of the squares of \( y_0[0] \) and \( y_0[1] \) be less than or equal to zero. Similarly, the negative square of \( t_1[0] \) plus the sum of the squares of \( y_1[0] \) and \( y_1[1] \) must be less than or equal to zero, and this pattern continues for the remaining second-order cone constraints.

All variables, including the four decision variables and the intermediate variables, are free to take any real value. The goal is to determine the values of these variables that minimize the objective function while satisfying all the linear equality constraints and second-order cone constraints.",3.19301949,1

The model includes three second-order cone constraints defined using auxiliary variables y_0, y_1, and y_2, each with three components, and free variables t_0, t_1, and t_2. The auxiliary variables are defined by twelve linear equations involving the decision variables x and the auxiliary variables y and t. For instance, the first auxiliary variable y_0 is defined by three linear equations: -0.00807132776099688 times x[0] minus 0.00829904212968852 times x[1] plus 0.00729131816846323 times x[2] minus 0.0158474183769015 times x[3] plus y_0[0] equals 0.0740447156962421; 0.0398011692418615 times x[0] minus 0.1170083202748537 times x[1] plus 0.0605494567209828 times x[2] plus 0.0296817366716117 times x[3] plus y_0[1] equals -0.0221765972469103; and -0.00578839554637137 times x[0] minus 0.0410660878455097 times x[1] plus 0.021468433180218 times x[2] plus 0.03829764846326 times x[3] plus y_0[2] equals 0.0261113199527866. The variable t_0[0] is defined by -0.5485199622075393 times x[0] plus 2.161356714141078 times x[1] plus 0.4583402094085766 times x[2] plus 0.4120351464853843 times x[3] plus t_0[0] equals 1.070594461920216. Similar sets of equations define y_1 and y_2, and their associated t variables.

The second-order cone constraints require that the square of t_0[0] must be greater than or equal to the sum of the squares of y_0[0], y_0[1], and y_0[2]; the square of t_1[0] must be greater than or equal to the sum of the squares of y_1[0], y_1[1], and y_1[2]; and the square of t_2[0] must be greater than or equal to the sum of the squares of y_2[0], y_2[1], and y_2[2]. All decision variables, including x, y_0, y_1, y_2, t_0, t_1, and t_2, are free to take any real value. The goal is to minimize the total cost while ensuring that all linear equality constraints and second-order cone constraints are satisfied.","\[

The model includes three second-order cone constraints defined using auxiliary variables y_0, y_1, and y_2, each with three components, and free variables t_0, t_1, and t_2. The auxiliary variables are defined by twelve linear equations involving the decision variables x and the auxiliary variables y and t. For instance, the first auxiliary variable y_0 is defined by three linear equations: -0.00807132776099688 times x[0] minus 0.00829904212968852 times x[1] plus 0.00729131816846323 times x[2] minus 0.0158474183769015 times x[3] plus y_0[0] equals 0.0740447156962421; 0.0398011692418615 times x[0] minus 0.1170083202748537 times x[1] plus 0.0605494567209828 times x[2] plus 0.0296817366716117 times x[3] plus y_0[1] equals -0.0221765972469103; and -0.00578839554637137 times x[0] minus 0.0410660878455097 times x[1] plus 0.021468433180218 times x[2] plus 0.03829764846326 times x[3] plus y_0[2] equals 0.0261113199527866. The variable t_0[0] is defined by -0.5485199622075393 times x[0] plus 2.161356714141078 times x[1] plus 0.4583402094085766 times x[2] plus 0.4120351464853843 times x[3] plus t_0[0] equals 1.070594461920216. Similar sets of equations define y_1 and y_2, and their associated t variables.

The second-order cone constraints require that the square of t_0[0] must be greater than or equal to the sum of the squares of y_0[0], y_0[1], and y_0[2]; the square of t_1[0] must be greater than or equal to the sum of the squares of y_1[0], y_1[1], and y_1[2]; and the square of t_2[0] must be greater than or equal to the sum of the squares of y_2[0], y_2[1], and y_2[2]. All decision variables, including x, y_0, y_1, y_2, t_0, t_1, and t_2, are free to take any real value. The goal is to minimize the total cost while ensuring that all linear equality constraints and second-order cone constraints are satisfied.",-3.6667438,1

The problem includes five linear equality constraints that must be satisfied. The first constraint requires that the weighted sum of the variables, adjusted by factors -0.5367684107949979, 0.1034203788533778, 1.846625038230486, 0.9784353550415096, -1.878216393450231, and -0.7467874898339996, equals 3.5678313588737.

The objective function coefficients are 0.9775739758894315 for \( x[0] \), -1.622521430954005 for \( x[1] \), and -0.3823943916427769 for \( x[2] \). All variables \( x[0] \), \( x[1] \), \( x[2] \), \( y_0[0] \), \( y_0[1] \), \( y_0[2] \), and \( t_0[0] \) are free.

The constraints include four linear equality constraints. The first constraint ensures that 2.218395151719285 times \( x[0] \) minus 0.4934367321170816 times \( x[1] \) plus 2.037698386055625 times \( x[2] \) equals -7.639024318581815. The second constraint ensures that 0.1288997654276396 times \( x[0] \) plus 0.4134151782133442 times \( x[1] \) minus 1.016848910244227 times \( x[2] \) equals 0.8282605412220725. The third constraint ensures that -0.3888036525234204 times \( x[0] \) plus 1.582023744531529 times \( x[1] \) plus 0.4853205141377102 times \( x[2] \) equals 0.9861388989442696. The fourth constraint ensures that -0.8184959408216979 times \( x[0] \) plus 0.1508892622723634 times \( x[1] \) plus 0.4877918700202323 times \( x[2] \) equals 1.575829009785032.

Additionally, there are four linear constraints defining \( y_0[0] \), \( y_0[1] \), \( y_0[2] \), and \( t_0[0] \) in terms of \( x[0] \), \( x[1] \), and \( x[2] \). The first constraint ensures that 0.000682161 times \( x[0] \) minus 0.058594741163783 times \( x[1] \) minus 0.2214986665992643 times \( x[2] \) plus \( y_0[0] \) equals 0.0363203305835107. The second constraint ensures that -0.00108977088958764 times \( x[0] \) plus 0.0836225593865622 times \( x[1] \) minus 0.2893750072155089 times \( x[2] \) plus \( y_0[1] \) equals -0.1460000637840041. The third constraint ensures that -0.0231877971791914 times \( x[0] \) minus 0.0340439160737732 times \( x[1] \) minus 0.2441350484603667 times \( x[2] \) plus \( y_0[2] \) equals 0.0702001695223133.

A second-order cone constraint ensures that the square of \( t_0[0] \) is less than or equal to the sum of the squares of \( y_0[0] \), \( y_0[1] \), and \( y_0[2] \), specifically expressed as \(-t_0[0]^2 + y_0[0]^2 + y_0[1]^2 + y_0[2]^2 \leq 0\). The goal is to determine the values of \( x[0] \), \( x[1] \), \( x[2] \), \( y_0[0] \), \( y_0[1] \), \( y_0[2] \), and \( t_0[0] \) that minimize the objective function while satisfying all constraints. This is a Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP) problem.",-2.5488419,1
141,"The problem involves minimizing a linear objective function defined by the coefficients 0.0169907447059004 for x[0], -0.1354658035191434 for x[1], and 0.1439797319070909 for x[2]. The optimization is subject to four linear equality constraints that balance the relationships between the variables x[0], x[1], and x[2]. The first constraint requires that 0.8636590559284738 times x[0] plus 0.0966833012301337 times x[1] minus 0.3152291953090132 times x[2] equals 0.8843372418353203. The second constraint requires that -1.308791116694014 times x[0] plus 1.026765786674754 times x[1] minus 1.641892627931514 times x[2] equals -3.068584167132096. The third constraint requires that -2.022894561574939 times x[0] plus 1.078027292135305 times x[1] minus 0.6806946931130862 times x[2] equals -3.878545364964277. The fourth constraint requires that 0.5909183755526639 times x[0] minus 1.227754194746086 times x[1] plus 0.9978468809169225 times x[2] equals 2.373932955061617. 

The problem also includes twelve additional linear constraints that introduce auxiliary variables y_0, y_1, y_2, and t_0, t_1, t_2. These constraints balance the primary variables x[0], x[1], and x[2] with the auxiliary variables. For example, constraint R4 requires that -0.0830895372455731 times x[0] plus 0.140196500160931 times x[1] plus 0.0835731570777216 times x[2] plus y_0[0] equals -0.0542756929304628. Similarly, constraints R5 through R15 impose similar relationships involving y_0[1], y_0[2], y_1[0], y_1[1], y_1[2], y_2[0], y_2[1], y_2[2], t_0[0], t_1[0], and t_2[0]. 

The problem also includes three second-order cone constraints, qc0, qc1, and qc2, which ensure that the sum of the squares of the auxiliary variables y_0[0], y_0[1], and y_0[2] does not exceed the square of t_0[0], the sum of the squares of y_1[0], y_1[1], and y_1[2] does not exceed the square of t_1[0], and the sum of the squares of y_2[0], y_2[1], and y_2[2] does not exceed the square of t_2[0]. All variables, including x[0], x[1], x[2], y_0[0], y_0[1], y_0[2], y_1[0], y_1[1], y_1[2], y_2[0], y_2[1], y_2[2], t_0[0], t_1[0], and t_2[0], are free to take any real value. The goal is to determine the values of these variables that minimize the objective function while satisfying all constraints.","\[

m.optimize()",No optimal value found.,,"The problem involves minimizing a linear objective function defined by the coefficients 0.0169907447059004 for x[0], -0.1354658035191434 for x[1], and 0.1439797319070909 for x[2]. The optimization is subject to four linear equality constraints that balance the relationships between the variables x[0], x[1], and x[2]. The first constraint requires that 0.8636590559284738 times x[0] plus 0.0966833012301337 times x[1] minus 0.3152291953090132 times x[2] equals 0.8843372418353203. The second constraint requires that -1.308791116694014 times x[0] plus 1.026765786674754 times x[1] minus 1.641892627931514 times x[2] equals -3.068584167132096. The third constraint requires that -2.022894561574939 times x[0] plus 1.078027292135305 times x[1] minus 0.6806946931130862 times x[2] equals -3.878545364964277. The fourth constraint requires that 0.5909183755526639 times x[0] minus 1.227754194746086 times x[1] plus 0.9978468809169225 times x[2] equals 2.373932955061617. 

The problem also includes twelve additional linear constraints that introduce auxiliary variables y_0, y_1, y_2, and t_0, t_1, t_2. These constraints balance the primary variables x[0], x[1], and x[2] with the auxiliary variables. For example, constraint R4 requires that -0.0830895372455731 times x[0] plus 0.140196500160931 times x[1] plus 0.0835731570777216 times x[2] plus y_0[0] equals -0.0542756929304628. Similarly, constraints R5 through R15 impose similar relationships involving y_0[1], y_0[2], y_1[0], y_1[1], y_1[2], y_2[0], y_2[1], y_2[2], t_0[0], t_1[0], and t_2[0]. 

The problem also includes three second-order cone constraints, qc0, qc1, and qc2, which ensure that the sum of the squares of the auxiliary variables y_0[0], y_0[1], and y_0[2] does not exceed the square of t_0[0], the sum of the squares of y_1[0], y_1[1], and y_1[2] does not exceed the square of t_1[0], and the sum of the squares of y_2[0], y_2[1], and y_2[2] does not exceed the square of t_2[0]. All variables, including x[0], x[1], x[2], y_0[0], y_0[1], y_0[2], y_1[0], y_1[1], y_1[2], y_2[0], y_2[1], y_2[2], t_0[0], t_1[0], and t_2[0], are free to take any real value.

The production levels of Components A, B, and C, as well as the auxiliary variables y_0[0], y_0[1], y_0[2], y_0[3], and t_0[0], are free to vary, and the process is subject to several constraints.

First, the production levels must satisfy three linear equality constraints. The first requires that -1.44151739228461 times the level of Component A plus 3.168186412960231 times the level of Component B minus 1.939318306738097 times the level of Component C equals -0.1920883547257966. The second requires that -2.518157292057484 times the level of Component A minus 0.045850744657515 times the level of Component B plus 0.8181912066930375 times the level of Component C equals 4.883115462374718.

Additionally, the production process involves four auxiliary variables, y_0[0], y_0[1], y_0[2], and y_0[3], which must satisfy four resource allocation constraints. The first requires that -0.0609720704349455 times the level of Component A plus 0.0577626224097794 times the level of Component B plus 0.1279201721670446 times the level of Component C plus y_0[0] equals 0.1618518754288826.

A second-order cone constraint must also be satisfied, where the sum of the squares of y_0[0], y_0[1], y_0[2], and y_0[3] minus the square of t_0[0] must be less than or equal to zero. The variable t_0[0] is determined by the production levels of Components A, B, and C, such that -0.4776208627305155 times the level of Component A minus 0.0366363201101301 times the level of Component B minus 0.5186224190772866 times the level of Component C plus t_0[0] equals 0.309414690634093.

The objective is to minimize the value of the objective function while satisfying all the above constraints and ensuring that the levels of Components A, B, and C, as well as the auxiliary variables y_0[0], y_0[1], y_0[2], y_0[3], and t_0[0], are free to vary within the given constraints. This problem is a Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP) problem, characterized by the second-order cone constraint that ties the auxiliary variables together in a specific relationship.","\[

The goal is to determine the values of these variables that minimize the objective function while satisfying all equality and quadratic cone constraints.",-2.0438316,0
148,"The problem involves determining the optimal allocation of five types of resources, represented by variables \( x[0] \) through \( x[4] \), along with auxiliary variables \( y_0[0] \), \( y_0[1] \), and \( t_0[0] \), to minimize the total cost defined by the linear objective function: \( 1.126401441072199 x[0] - 0.3048391076081773 x[1] + 1.210295701208876 x[2] + 0.3629036707879342 x[3] - 1.541074052220742 x[4] \). 

The solution must satisfy four linear equality constraints: the first requires \( -0.9907409502145462 x[0] - 0.7264863472262246 x[1] + 0.2793136098129854 x[2] - 0.9349403902445268 x[3] + 1.444658005223368 x[4] = 1.116201276984661 \); the second requires \( 2.936722209688262 x[0] + 0.5035733953314866 x[1] + 0.3357143231898844 x[2] + 1.112758520098299 x[3] + 1.412597032089028 x[4] = -1.571971227040746 \); the third requires \( 0.7899614064673852 x[0] - 0.0724234240750259 x[1] - 0.7706602505688044 x[2] + 1.907488050972312 x[3] + 1.420058526737699 x[4] = -1.686571012140405 \); and the fourth requires \( 0.6068754572874664 x[0] + 0.7492819480236036 x[1] - 1.565830499338323 x[2] + 0.2718401004423009 x[3] + 0.5510027846961619 x[4] = 4.014442756917189 \).

Additionally, three linear equality constraints, labeled R4, R5, and R6, tie the resource allocations to auxiliary variables \( y_0[0] \), \( y_0[1] \), and \( t_0[0] \): R4 requires \( -0.0124992573250491 x[0] - 0.1193568402945484 x[1] - 0.0200307964468845 x[2] + 0.0612863681420025 x[3] - 0.116537049877206 x[4] + y_0[0] = -0.0358590805559009 \); R5 requires \( 0.0484815211698107 x[0] - 0.0631246556642578 x[1] + 0.1244200448905836 x[2] + 0.0530487576814488 x[3] + 0.1361347655297342 x[4] + y_0[1] = 0.0271906214446268 \); and R6 requires \( -2.249909202694956 x[0] + 0.7776031115768471 x[1] - 0.2174454691465576 x[2] + 1.953508135119546 x[3] + 1.071251451084194 x[4] + t_0[0] = 0.9059772765697818 \).

A second-order cone constraint, labeled \( qc0 \), ensures that the sum of the squares of \( y_0[0] \) and \( y_0[1] \) does not exceed the square of \( t_0[0] \), expressed as \( -t_0[0]^2 + y_0[0]^2 + y_0[1]^2 \leq 0 \). All decision variables, including \( x[0] \) through \( x[4] \), \( y_0[0] \), \( y_0[1] \), and \( t_0[0] \), are unrestricted in sign, meaning they can take any real value to satisfy the constraints and optimize the objective. This is a Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP) problem that combines linear and quadratic constraints, requiring a balance between resource allocation and auxiliary variables to achieve the optimal solution while minimizing total cost.","\[

Additionally, three linear equality constraints, labeled R4, R5, and R6, tie the resource allocations to auxiliary variables \( y_0[0] \), \( y_0[1] \), and \( t_0[0] \): R4 requires \( -0.0124992573250491 x[0] - 0.1193568402945484 x[1] - 0.0200307964468845 x[2] + 0.0612863681420025 x[3] - 0.116537049877206 x[4] + y_0[0] = -0.0358590805559009 \); R5 requires \( 0.0484815211698107 x[0] - 0.0631246556642578 x[1] + 0.1244200448905836 x[2] + 0.0530487576814488 x[3] + 0.1361347655297342 x[4] + y_0[1] = 0.0271906214446268 \); and R6 requires \( -2.249909202694956 x[0] + 0.7776031115768471 x[1] - 0.2174454691465576 x[2] + 1.953508135119546 x[3] + 1.071251451084194 x[4] + t_0[0] = 0.9059772765697818 \).

A second-order cone constraint, labeled \( qc0 \), ensures that the sum of the squares of \( y_0[0] \) and \( y_0[1] \) does not exceed the square of \( t_0[0] \), expressed as \( -t_0[0]^2 + y_0[0]^2 + y_0[1]^2 \leq 0 \). All decision variables, including \( x[0] \) through \( x[4] \), \( y_0[0] \), \( y_0[1] \), and \( t_0[0] \), are unrestricted in sign, meaning they can take any real value to satisfy the constraints and optimize the objective. This is a Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP) problem that combines linear and quadratic constraints, requiring a balance between resource allocation and auxiliary variables to achieve the optimal solution while minimizing total cost.",-5.0688283,0
149,"The production manager seeks to minimize the total production cost for four product lines, \( x[0] \), \( x[1] \), \( x[2] \), and \( x[3] \), with costs of \( -0.0211519215863677 \), \( -0.157914420869699 \), \( -1.276226636497168 \), and \( 1.887428393936258 \) per unit, respectively. Negative coefficients in the objective function represent costs to be minimized, not cost savings. Four linear equality constraints must be satisfied: the first requires a weighted sum of production levels using coefficients \( -0.6903544941297689 \), \( 0.184421264426265 \), \( 0.2271145373127337 \), and \( 0.3261334256865931 \) to equal \( -1.784682154876947 \). The second constraint uses coefficients \( 0.9527280569937944 \), \( -0.227563767653628 \), \( -0.1388448211471715 \), and \( -0.7259447957545259 \) to sum to \( 3.071741041299838 \). The third constraint uses coefficients \( -0.2904848690892891 \), \( 0.6067085131648451 \), \( 0.5360035950278403 \), and \( 1.175919727086906 \) to sum to \( -3.247120484557859 \). The fourth constraint uses coefficients \( -1.447328047167681 \), \( 1.078800425952911 \), \( -1.071986023688645 \), and \( 2.402600530074645 \) to sum to \( -9.240805229261266 \).

Twelve auxiliary variables, \( y_0[0] \), \( y_0[1] \), \( y_1[0] \), \( y_1[1] \), \( y_2[0] \), \( y_2[1] \), \( y_3[0] \), \( y_3[1] \), \( t_0[0] \), \( t_1[0] \), \( t_2[0] \), and \( t_3[0] \), are introduced to model resource usage and operational safety. These variables are part of twelve additional linear constraints: R4 through R15. For example, R4 states that \( -0.00544743187557857 \) times \( x[0] \), minus \( 0.1023858515949546 \) times \( x[1] \), minus \( 0.2570937910987342 \) times \( x[2] \), minus \( 0.0303903824324441 \) times \( x[3] \), plus \( y_0[0] \), equals \( 0.0630402459981765 \). Similar relationships define R5 through R15.

Four quadratic constraints ensure safe operational limits: the sum of the squares of \( y_0[0] \) and \( y_0[1] \) must be less than or equal to the square of \( t_0[0] \); the sum of the squares of \( y_1[0] \) and \( y_1[1] \) must be less than or equal to the square of \( t_1[0] \); the sum of the squares of \( y_2[0] \) and \( y_2[1] \) must be less than or equal to the square of \( t_2[0] \); and the sum of the squares of \( y_3[0] \) and \( y_3[1] \) must be less than or equal to the square of \( t_3[0] \). All decision variables, including production levels and auxiliary variables, are free to take any real value. The goal is to determine the optimal production levels for \( x[0] \), \( x[1] \), \( x[2] \), and \( x[3] \) that minimize total production cost while satisfying all constraints. This problem is a Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP) problem, as indicated by the quadratic constraints and the structure of the model.","\[

m.optimize()",-4.29874202,,"The production manager seeks to minimize the total production cost for four product lines, \( x[0] \), \( x[1] \), \( x[2] \), and \( x[3] \), with costs of \( -0.0211519215863677 \), \( -0.157914420869699 \), \( -1.276226636497168 \), and \( 1.887428393936258 \) per unit, respectively. Negative coefficients in the objective function represent costs to be minimized, not cost savings. Four linear equality constraints must be satisfied: the first requires a weighted sum of production levels using coefficients \( -0.6903544941297689 \), \( 0.184421264426265 \), \( 0.2271145373127337 \), and \( 0.3261334256865931 \) to equal \( -1.784682154876947 \). The second constraint uses coefficients \( 0.9527280569937944 \), \( -0.227563767653628 \), \( -0.1388448211471715 \), and \( -0.7259447957545259 \) to sum to \( 3.071741041299838 \). The third constraint uses coefficients \( -0.2904848690892891 \), \( 0.6067085131648451 \), \( 0.5360035950278403 \), and \( 1.175919727086906 \) to sum to \( -3.247120484557859 \). The fourth constraint uses coefficients \( -1.447328047167681 \), \( 1.078800425952911 \), \( -1.071986023688645 \), and \( 2.402600530074645 \) to sum to \( -9.240805229261266 \).

Twelve auxiliary variables, \( y_0[0] \), \( y_0[1] \), \( y_1[0] \), \( y_1[1] \), \( y_2[0] \), \( y_2[1] \), \( y_3[0] \), \( y_3[1] \), \( t_0[0] \), \( t_1[0] \), \( t_2[0] \), and \( t_3[0] \), are introduced to model resource usage and operational safety. These variables are part of twelve additional linear constraints: R4 through R15. For example, R4 states that \( -0.00544743187557857 \) times \( x[0] \), minus \( 0.1023858515949546 \) times \( x[1] \), minus \( 0.2570937910987342 \) times \( x[2] \), minus \( 0.0303903824324441 \) times \( x[3] \), plus \( y_0[0] \), equals \( 0.0630402459981765 \). Similar relationships define R5 through R15.

Four quadratic constraints ensure safe operational limits: the sum of the squares of \( y_0[0] \) and \( y_0[1] \) must be less than or equal to the square of \( t_0[0] \); the sum of the squares of \( y_1[0] \) and \( y_1[1] \) must be less than or equal to the square of \( t_1[0] \); the sum of the squares of \( y_2[0] \) and \( y_2[1] \) must be less than or equal to the square of \( t_2[0] \); and the sum of the squares of \( y_3[0] \) and \( y_3[1] \) must be less than or equal to the square of \( t_3[0] \). All decision variables, including production levels and auxiliary variables, are free to take any real value. The goal is to determine the optimal production levels for \( x[0] \), \( x[1] \), \( x[2] \), and \( x[3] \) that minimize total production cost while satisfying all constraints.

These variables are free to take any real value. The problem is subject to 18 linear equality constraints. The first three constraints enforce specific relationships: the sum of \(-1.712919234088719\) units from \(x[0]\), \(0.5094892843494099\) units from \(x[1]\), and \(-1.176977823298391\) units from \(x[2]\) must equal \(1.969673610649569\); the sum of \(0.370350858647903\) units from \(x[0]\), \(0.1859117162151037\) units from \(x[1]\), and \(0.4554018017289621\) units from \(x[2]\) must equal \(-0.42565571941171\); and the sum of \(1.568958943694931\) units from \(x[0]\), \(0.1377471346710665\) units from \(x[1]\), and \(-0.5120283579251602\) units from \(x[2]\) must equal \(-0.6850278359750025\). The remaining 15 constraints involve auxiliary variables \(y_i[j]\) and \(t_i[0]\), which are also free, and enforce linear relationships between these variables and the decision variables. For \(i=0\), the sum of \(0.0870156668345264\) units from \(x[0]\), \(0.0507128953480789\) units from \(x[1]\), \(0.2266461831421958\) units from \(x[2]\), and \(y_0[0]\) must equal \(-0.1485711357308674\).

These patterns continue for \(i=1\), \(i=2\), and \(i=3\), with similar linear relationships defined for \(y_i[j]\) and \(t_i[0]\). The problem also includes four quadratic constraints, which are second-order cone constraints. These constraints ensure that for each set of auxiliary variables \(y_i[0]\), \(y_i[1]\), and \(y_i[2]\), the squared sum of these variables does not exceed the square of \(t_i[0]\). The goal is to determine the values of the decision and auxiliary variables that minimize the objective function while satisfying all linear and quadratic constraints.","\[

These variables are free to take any real value. The problem is subject to 18 linear equality constraints.

The remaining 15 constraints involve auxiliary variables \(y_i[j]\) and \(t_i[0]\), which are also free, and enforce linear relationships between these variables and the decision variables. For \(i=0\), the sum of \(0.0870156668345264\) units from \(x[0]\), \(0.0507128953480789\) units from \(x[1]\), \(0.2266461831421958\) units from \(x[2]\), and \(y_0[0]\) must equal \(-0.1485711357308674\).

These patterns continue for \(i=1\), \(i=2\), and \(i=3\), with similar linear relationships defined for \(y_i[j]\) and \(t_i[0]\). The problem also includes four quadratic constraints, which are second-order cone constraints. These constraints ensure that for each set of auxiliary variables \(y_i[0]\), \(y_i[1]\), and \(y_i[2]\), the squared sum of these variables does not exceed the square of \(t_i[0]\). The goal is to determine the values of the decision and auxiliary variables that minimize the objective function while satisfying all linear and quadratic constraints.",1.42027477,0
153,"The problem involves optimizing the allocation of five free variables \( x[0] \) to \( x[4] \), along with auxiliary variables \( y_0[0] \) to \( y_2[3] \) and \( t_0[0] \) to \( t_2[0] \), which are also free. The objective is to minimize the expression \(-0.4183092460544717 x[0] - 0.2813052479554071 x[1] + 0.134543055273074 x[2] + 0.3293895938730942 x[3] - 0.5013729625677056 x[4]\). The problem is subject to five linear equality constraints. The first constraint requires \(-0.2042258848533399 x[0] + 0.2505367949866907 x[1] - 0.4309025998889995 x[2] + 1.309402520858531 x[3] + 2.586402096787606 x[4] = -3.156703022107761\). The second constraint imposes \(-0.9968810525037243 x[0] - 0.4546685233810487 x[1] + 0.4750317828663017 x[2] + 0.266787146193911 x[3] - 1.191880626574726 x[4] = -2.176991821226254\). The third constraint requires \(0.349956286844281 x[0] + 1.015584003075466 x[1] - 0.0836288458590485 x[2] - 0.0695677711676667 x[3] + 0.104824587707105 x[4] = 2.926695432150372\). The fourth constraint enforces \(0.7470800133528747 x[0] + 0.8253890222140957 x[1] + 0.0968330451370987 x[2] + 0.7049632173662657 x[3] + 0.7872792028260496 x[4] = 0.5732174371789283\). The fifth constraint requires \(-1.307269223716067 x[0] + 0.3813744238506016 x[1] - 0.4050739984159557 x[2] + 1.424197873139263 x[3] + 0.4653468565843648 x[4] = -3.193503084865396\).

Additionally, the problem includes constraints linking the variables \( x[0] \) to \( x[4] \) with auxiliary variables \( y_0[0] \) to \( y_2[3] \). For example, the first linking constraint requires \(-0.3645044940419532 x[0] - 1.443832971588788 x[1] + 0.461589002970339 x[2] + 0.2606857473736294 x[3] + 1.721110703706202 x[4] + y_0[0] = -0.9152180704947402\). Similar constraints exist for \( y_0[1] \), \( y_0[2] \), \( y_0[3] \), \( y_1[0] \), \( y_1[1] \), \( y_1[2] \), \( y_1[3] \), \( y_2[0] \), \( y_2[1] \), \( y_2[2] \), and \( y_2[3] \), each with specific coefficients and target values.

The problem also includes quadratic constraints involving the variables \( t_0[0] \), \( t_1[0] \), and \( t_2[0] \). The first quadratic constraint ensures that \(-t_0[0]^2 + y_0[0]^2 + y_0[1]^2 + y_0[2]^2 + y_0[3]^2 \leq 0\). The second quadratic constraint requires \(-t_1[0]^2 + y_1[0]^2 + y_1[1]^2 + y_1[2]^2 + y_1[3]^2 \leq 0\), and the third quadratic constraint enforces \(-t_2[0]^2 + y_2[0]^2 + y_2[1]^2 + y_2[2]^2 + y_2[3]^2 \leq 0\). These constraints ensure that the relationships between the auxiliary variables and the safety buffers are maintained. The goal is to minimize the objective function while satisfying all linear equality, linking, and quadratic constraints.","\[

m.optimize()",-1.650565263,,"The problem involves optimizing the allocation of five free variables \( x[0] \) to \( x[4] \), along with auxiliary variables \( y_0[0] \) to \( y_2[3] \) and \( t_0[0] \) to \( t_2[0] \), which are also free. The objective is to minimize the expression \(-0.4183092460544717 x[0] - 0.2813052479554071 x[1] + 0.134543055273074 x[2] + 0.3293895938730942 x[3] - 0.5013729625677056 x[4]\). The problem is subject to five linear equality constraints. The first constraint requires \(-0.2042258848533399 x[0] + 0.2505367949866907 x[1] - 0.4309025998889995 x[2] + 1.309402520858531 x[3] + 2.586402096787606 x[4] = -3.156703022107761\). The second constraint imposes \(-0.9968810525037243 x[0] - 0.4546685233810487 x[1] + 0.4750317828663017 x[2] + 0.266787146193911 x[3] - 1.191880626574726 x[4] = -2.176991821226254\). The third constraint requires \(0.349956286844281 x[0] + 1.015584003075466 x[1] - 0.0836288458590485 x[2] - 0.0695677711676667 x[3] + 0.104824587707105 x[4] = 2.926695432150372\).

The fifth constraint requires \(-1.307269223716067 x[0] + 0.3813744238506016 x[1] - 0.4050739984159557 x[2] + 1.424197873139263 x[3] + 0.4653468565843648 x[4] = -3.193503084865396\).

Additionally, the problem includes constraints linking the variables \( x[0] \) to \( x[4] \) with auxiliary variables \( y_0[0] \) to \( y_2[3] \). For example, the first linking constraint requires \(-0.3645044940419532 x[0] - 1.443832971588788 x[1] + 0.461589002970339 x[2] + 0.2606857473736294 x[3] + 1.721110703706202 x[4] + y_0[0] = -0.9152180704947402\). Similar constraints exist for \( y_0[1] \), \( y_0[2] \), \( y_0[3] \), \( y_1[0] \), \( y_1[1] \), \( y_1[2] \), \( y_1[3] \), \( y_2[0] \), \( y_2[1] \), \( y_2[2] \), and \( y_2[3] \), each with specific coefficients and target values.

The problem also includes quadratic constraints involving the variables \( t_0[0] \), \( t_1[0] \), and \( t_2[0] \). The first quadratic constraint ensures that \(-t_0[0]^2 + y_0[0]^2 + y_0[1]^2 + y_0[2]^2 + y_0[3]^2 \leq 0\). The second quadratic constraint requires \(-t_1[0]^2 + y_1[0]^2 + y_1[1]^2 + y_1[2]^2 + y_1[3]^2 \leq 0\), and the third quadratic constraint enforces \(-t_2[0]^2 + y_2[0]^2 + y_2[1]^2 + y_2[2]^2 + y_2[3]^2 \leq 0\). These constraints ensure that the relationships between the auxiliary variables and the safety buffers are maintained. The goal is to minimize the objective function while satisfying all linear equality, linking, and quadratic constraints.",-1.6505653,1

A second-order cone constraint is imposed, requiring that the sum of the squares of \(y_0[0]\), \(y_0[1]\), and \(y_0[2]\) should not exceed the square of \(t_0[0]\). All decision variables \(x_0\), \(x_1\), \(x_2\), \(y_0[0]\), \(y_0[1]\), \(y_0[2]\), and \(t_0[0]\) are free to take any real value, meaning there are no upper or lower bounds imposed on their values. The goal is to determine the optimal allocation of \(x_0\), \(x_1\), and \(x_2\) to minimize the total cost while satisfying all the above constraints, including the second-order cone constraint.

To ensure operational feasibility, each hub must satisfy a second-order cone constraint. For Hub 0, the sum of the squares of y_0[0] and y_0[1] must be less than or equal to the square of t_0[0]. Similarly, for Hub 1, the sum of the squares of y_1[0] and y_1[1] must be less than or equal to the square of t_1[0]. For Hub 2, the sum of the squares of y_2[0] and y_2[1] must be less than or equal to the square of t_2[0]. For Hub 3, the sum of the squares of y_3[0] and y_3[1] must be less than or equal to the square of t_3[0]. For Hub 4, the sum of the squares of y_4[0] and y_4[1] must be less than or equal to the square of t_4[0].

All variables, including resource allocations and auxiliary variables, are free to take any real value, allowing for flexible resource allocation to minimize costs while satisfying all operational constraints. The problem is a Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP) problem, as it involves quadratic constraints represented by the second-order cone constraints. The equality constraints are linear, while the additional constraints (R3 to R17) link resource allocations to secondary operational metrics. The auxiliary variables (y_0[0], y_0[1], t_0[0], etc.) are part of the second-order cone constraints, and all variables (x[0] to x[4], y_0[0], y_0[1], y_1[0], y_1[1], etc., and t_0[0], t_1[0], t_2[0], etc.) are free variables.","\[

The three second-order cone constraints are as follows: the first cone constraint requires that the sum of the squares of y_0[0], y_0[1], and y_0[2] is at most the square of t_0[0]. The second cone constraint requires that the sum of the squares of y_1[0], y_1[1], and y_1[2] is at most the square of t_1[0]. The third cone constraint requires that the sum of the squares of y_2[0], y_2[1], and y_2[2] is at most the square of t_2[0]. All decision variables, including the resource allocations x[0], x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4], and x[5], and the auxiliary variables y_0[0], y_0[1], y_0[2], y_1[0], y_1[1], y_1[2], y_2[0], y_2[1], y_2[2], t_0[0], t_1[0], and t_2[0], are free to take any real value. The goal is to determine the optimal allocation of the six resources that minimizes the total cost while satisfying all linear equality and second-order cone constraints.","\[
