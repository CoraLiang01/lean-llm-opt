"An international humanitarian aid organization needs to airlift a batch of relief supplies to the disaster-stricken area. The existing parameters of standard freight containers are as follows:
Maximum load capacity: 55 tons
Minimum loading requirement: 20 tons
Internal dimensions: 16.0m × 3.0m × 3.0m (length × width × height), that is, the maximum internal volume is 144m ³
This batch of disaster relief supplies is divided into five categories. The total quantity, individual weight and individual volume dimensions are respectively:
Medical tents (A) : 100 pieces, each weighing 0.6 tons, with a volume of 0.70m × 1.2m × 1.2m
Portable water purification device (B) : 80 pieces, each piece weighing 1.2 tons, volume 0.25m × 2.2m × 2.2m
First aid Kit (C) : 250 pieces, each weighing 0.35 tons, with a volume of 0.40m × 1.8m × 1.1m
Lighting group (D) : 100 pieces, each piece weighs 0.55 tons, and the volume is 0.22m × 3.2m × 1.1m
Thermal insulation blanket (E) : 140 pieces, each piece weighs 0.7 tons, and the volume is 0.20m × 5.5m × 1.2m
Packing requirements and constraints
Minimum loading capacity: The total weight of each container must not be less than 20 tons.
Maximum load and volume limits: The total weight of each container must not exceed 55 tons, and the total volume must not exceed 144 cubic meters.
Matching constraints: If at least one medical tent (A) is loaded in a certain container, then at least two first aid kits (C) must be loaded in this container. If only the first aid kit is installed, this restriction does not apply.
Global loading volume: All the pieces of the above-mentioned various materials (A:100, B:80, C:250, D:100, E:140) must be loaded into certain containers.
Packing plan objective
Under the premise of meeting the above-mentioned upper and lower weight limits, upper volume limits, matching constraints and total shipment requirements, design the container loading scheme to minimize the number of containers used.",,"Minimize
