"Based on flight ticket options provided in './Test_Dataset/Air_NRM/information.csv', along with their associated attraction values (v1) and shadow attraction value ratios (v2), develop a Sales-Based Linear Programming (SBLP) model. The goal of this model is to recommend the optimal 3 flights that maximize total ticket sale revenue, specifically among flights with an origin-destination: OD = ('A', 'B') and a departure period (11am-1pm) in which the flights are: [(OD = ('A', 'B') AND Departure Time='11:20'), (OD = ('A', 'B') AND Departure Time='12:40')]"
"Based on all flight ticket choices in 'information1_addB_2.csv' with attraction values in v1 and shadow attraction value ratios in v2, develop the SBLP(sales-based linear programming) formulation  with flights (OD = ('B', 'A') AND Departure Time='12:25'), (OD = ('C', 'B') AND Departure Time='14:15'), (OD = ('B', 'A') AND Departure Time='20:25') that maximize the total revenue of flight ticket sales. The SBLP should include decision variables, objective function, balance constraints, scale constraints, nonnegative constraints."
