"Based on all flight ticket choices in 'information1_addB_2.csv' with attraction values in v1 and shadow attraction value ratios in v2, develop the SBLP(sales-based linear programming) formulation  with flights (OD = ('B', 'A') AND Departure Time='12:25'), (OD = ('C', 'B') AND Departure Time='14:15'), (OD = ('B', 'A') AND Departure Time='20:25') that maximize the total revenue of flight ticket sales. The SBLP should include decision variables, objective function, balance constraints, scale constraints, nonnegative constraints.",
