There are 10 source locations (S1,S2,...,S10) and 20 demand locations (D1-D20). Each truck is loaded with 10 units of cargo and can only be dispatched in whole trucks (integer trips).The supply information for each supplier (S1-S10) is detailed in expanded_sources.csv. The demand information for each demand locations (D1-D20) is listed in expanded_destinations.csv. The unit costs for each truck in different routes are known in expanded_cost_matrix.csv. Truck loading is allowed to be partial; the number of dispatched trucks per route must be integer. Costs are per unit (cargo), not per truck. The source of goods is constrained and the demand is fixed. Our goal is to meet all demands and minimize the total transportation cost, which is measured in units of each cargo.
