You are given a catalog of 42 university courses across six disciplines: Literature, Mathematics, Physics, Operations Research, Computer Science, and Chemistry. Each course has an associated number of credits and an “interest points” score. The student wants to enroll in a subset of courses from the "Operations Research" discipline. The goal is to choose a combination of Operations Research courses whose total credits no more than 20 and whose total interest points are maximized.
