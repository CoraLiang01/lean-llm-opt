I should pay attention if there is further detailed constraint in the problem description. If so, I should generate additional constraint formula. Do NOT include any explanations, notes, or extra text. Respond ONLY in this exact format: {label}. Following this example. The expressions should not be simplified or abbreviated. Besides, I need to use the $$ or $ to wrap the mathematical expressions instead of \\[, \\], \\( or \\). I also should avoid using align, align* and other latex environments. Besides, I should also avoid using \\begin, \\end, \\text.\n",

The assembly times per unit at each station are shown in workstation_times.csv. Daily maintenance of workstation 1, workstation 2, and workstation 3 takes 10%, 14%, and 12% of the total available time of each workstation, and the maximum available time of each workstation is 480 minutes a day. Determine the optimal production mix to minimize total idle time across all workstations while respecting maintenance schedules.\n",

I must account for the maintenance time at each workstation, reducing the available time accordingly. The objective is to minimize the total idle time, which is the unused time at each workstation after production and maintenance. I will define decision variables for the number of HiFi-1 and HiFi-2 units produced. The constraints will ensure that the total production time plus maintenance does not exceed the available time at each workstation, and the idle time is non-negative.\n",

The problem involves determining the optimal transportation plan that satisfies the demands of 4 customer groups, whose daily demand data is provided in \"customer_demands.csv\". These demands must be met using supplies from 3 Walmart stores, each with a specific daily supply capacity detailed in \"supply_capacity.csv\". The transportation cost per unit of goods from each Walmart store to each customer group is recorded in \"transportation_costs.csv\". The objective is to determine the quantity of goods transported from each Walmart store to each customer group, ensuring that all demands are met without exceeding the supply capacity of any store, while minimizing the total transportation cost.\\nData_address: TP_example/customer_demand.csv\\nTP_example/supply_capacity.csv\\nTP_example/transportation_costs.csv\\nLabel: Minimize\\n   0.63 x_0_0 + 49.71 x_0_1 + 33.75 x_0_2 + 1570.67 x_0_3 + 605.47 x_1_0 + 64.53 x_1_1 + 478.47 x_1_2 + 887.04 x_1_3 + 1139.04 x_2_0 + 4.78 x_2_1 + 1805.62 x_2_2 + 1302.89 x_2_3 \\nSubject To\\n demand_constraint:\\n x_0_0 + x_1_0 + x_2_0 >= 11\\n x_0_1 + x_1_1 + x_2_1 >= 1148\\n x_0_2 + x_1_2 + x_2_2 >= 54\\n x_0_3 + x_1_3 + x_2_3 >= 833\\n capacity_constraint:\\n x_0_0 + x_0_1 + x_0_2 + x_0_3 <= 4\\n x_1_0 + x_1_1 + x_1_2 + x_1_3 <= 575\\n x_2_0 + x_2_1 + x_2_2 + x_2_3 <= 1504\\nGenerals\\n x_0_0  x_0_1  x_0_2  x_0_3  x_1_0  x_1_1  x_1_2  x_1_3\\n x_2_0  x_2_1  x_2_2  x_2_3  \\nEND\\nRelated: \\nProblem Type: Transportation Problem')]}\u001b[0m\n",

Each distribution center incurs a fixed cost, denoted by f_1, f_2, and f_3, respectively. The branches have specific product demands that must be met by the distributioncenters. For branch X, the transportation cost per unit of goods from distribution centers A, B, and C is c_11, c_12, and c_13 respectively. Similarly, for branch Y, the transportation costs from distribution centers A, B, and C are c_21, c_22, and c_23 respectively.
