A factory plans purchasing and production for 100 products (P1–P100) over a single planning horizon. Each product can only be purchased/produced in whole batches, where one batch equals 10 units. Producing one unit of any product consumes three limited resources (R1, R2, R3). Each product also faces an upper demand bound; producing beyond this bound is not allowed (unmet demand is permitted). The goal is to choose batch quantities to maximize total profit (=sum over products of (10 × x_i × profit_per_unit_i)) while respecting all resource and demand limits.

The referring data is listed in the csv file. factory_products_100.csv consists of profit earned per produced unit (positive, real). Among them r1_per_unit, r2_per_unit, r3_per_unit represent resource consumption per produced unit for R1, R2, R3 (real) respectively. upper_demand_units means maximum market demand (units) for the product (integers not equal to multiples of 10, so batch decisions meaningfully interact with demand). And batch_size_units is fixed batch size in units (constant = 10)
resources_capacities.csv includes total available amount of each resource in the horizon (real)
