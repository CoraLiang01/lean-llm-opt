"A bank is planning its loan allocation strategy across 7 different industry sectors (S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7). Within each of these sectors, the bank can provide loans across up to 6 loan types, labeled L1 through L6 (for example: Short-Term, Medium-Term, Long-Term, Consumer, SME, and Real Estate).

The bank has the following data, organized in three separate CSV tables:

ProjectedInterestIncome.csv:
Each cell represents the expected interest income earned per million dollars invested in a given combination of sector and loan type (sector *loan type).

RiskWeight.csv:
Each cell shows the estimated risk weight associated with lending one million dollars in the corresponding combination of sector and loan type.
(Risk weights reflect factors such as the financial health of the sector, characteristics of the loan type, and current macroeconomic trends.)

LendingAllocationCaps.csv:
Each cell indicates the maximum allowable allocation (in millions of dollars) that can be lent in each combination of industry sector and loan type.

The bank wants to determine a lending allocation plan across the sectors and loan types to maximize the total expected interest income while:
Do not exceeding the per-loan-type allocation (per sector) caps;
Total risk-weighted exposure must stay below a regulatory cap: Total risk-weighted exposure cap: $14.0$;
Minimum lending requirement: The total lending across all sectors and loan types must be at least $30 million;
All allocations must be in integer millions.","Large_Scale_Or_Files/Other_example/18/ProjectedInterestIncome.csv

"A supermarket needs to replenish its daily stock of flour and rice to meet customer demand while minimizing total procurement costs. The exact required quantities are 100 kg of flour and 80 kg of rice. No more, no less. There are two existing suppliers (Supplier 1 and 2) that must be used, though order quantities from them can vary. Additionally, two new suppliers (Supplier 3 and 4) are available, but selecting any new supplier incurs a fixed management fee of 50 RMB per supplier (e.g., choosing Supplier 3 adds 50 RMB, while selecting both adds 100 RMB). If a new supplier is not chosen, no orders can be placed with them. The total cost consists of procurement expenses from all selected suppliers plus the fixed fees for any new suppliers. The objective is to minimize total cost as the primary goal, with a secondary preference for using fewer new suppliers.
