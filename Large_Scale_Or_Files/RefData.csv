"The data of the store offers several styles of Nike shoes is provided in ""Nike Shoes Sales.csv"". Through the dataset, the revenue of each shoes is listed in the column ""revenue"". The demand for each style is independent. The store__ objective is to maximize the total expected revenue based on the fixed initial inventories of the Nike x Olivia Kim brand, which are detailed in column __nventory._ During the sales horizon, no replenishment is allowed, and there are no in-transit inventories. Customer arrivals, corresponding to demand for different styles of Nike shoes, occur in each period according to a Poisson process, with arrival rates specified in column __emand._ Moreover, the trade will be started only when the total demand is no less than 100 to ensure the trading efficiency. The decision variables y_i represent the number of customer requests the store intends to fulfill for Nike shoe style i, with each y_i being a positive integer.

"A supermarket needs to allocate various products, including high-demand items like the Sony Alpha Refrigerator, Sony Bravia XR, and Sony PlayStation 5, across different retail shelves. The product values and space requirements are provided in the ""Products.csv"" dataset. Additionally, the store has multiple shelves, each with a total space limit and specific space constraints for Sony and Apple products, as outlined in the ""Capacity.csv"" file.
