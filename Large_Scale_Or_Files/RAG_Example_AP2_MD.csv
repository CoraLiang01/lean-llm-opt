"In the construction sector, there is a group of managers and a set of construction projects. The cost for a manager to oversee a specific project varies depending on their expertise and experience. This cost data is stored in a CSV file named 'manager_project_cost.csv', where each row corresponds to a manager and each column indicates the cost for that manager to handle a particular project. The aim is to determine the optimal assignment strategy that minimizes the overall cost of completing all projects. Each manager should be assigned to the project where their cost is lowest, ensuring that every project is managed by exactly one manager, and each manager is responsible for exactly one project. The goal is to minimize the total cost while adhering to the constraints that each project is assigned to one manager and each manager is assigned to one project",Large_Scale_Or_Files/AP_example/AP1/manager_project_cost.csv,"
##### Objective Function: 

$\quad \quad \min \sum_{i=1}^3 \sum_{j=1}^3 c_{ij} x_{ij} $

##### Constraints

###### 1. Assignment Constraints: 

$\sum_{j=1}^3 x_{ij} = 1 \quad \forall i \in \{1,2,3\} $

$\sum_{i=1}^3 x_{ij} = 1 \quad \forall j \in \{1,2,3\}$

###### 2. Variable Constraints: 

$\quad \quad x_{ij} \in \{{0,1\\} \quad \forall i,j $
