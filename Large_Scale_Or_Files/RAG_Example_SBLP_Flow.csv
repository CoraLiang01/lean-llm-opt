"Based on flight ticket options provided in file ""./Test_Dataset/Air_NRM/information.csv"", along with their average passengers (Avg Pax), average prices (Avg Price), and capacity coefficients (Flex Cpy Coef), considering that each Eco_flex ticket consumes 2 units of flight capacity and each Eco_lite ticket consumes 1 unit of capacity, while enforcing flow conservation constraints at each airport for long-term planning model, develop a Sales-Based Linear Programming (SBLP) model. 

The goal of this model is to recommend the optimal 3 flights that maximize total ticket sale revenue, specifically among flights where the origin-destination pairs are: 
OD = ('A', 'B') or OD = ('A', 'C') or OD = ('B', 'A') or OD = ('B', 'C') or ('C', 'A') or ('C', 'B') in a departure period (7am-12:00am) in which the optional flights are:
[(OD = ('C', 'A') AND Departure Time='7:40'),
(OD = ('C', 'B') AND Departure Time='7:40'),
(OD = ('B', 'A') AND Departure Time='9:05'),
(OD = ('B', 'C') AND Departure Time='9:05'),
(OD = ('C', 'B') AND Departure Time='10:45'),
(OD = ('A', 'B') AND Departure Time='11:20'),
(OD = ('B', 'C') AND Departure Time='11:20')]",
