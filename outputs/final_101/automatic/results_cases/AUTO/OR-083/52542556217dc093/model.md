[Abstract Model Plan START]
1.  **Analyze Query:** The user wants to assign 10 out of 12 available workers to 10 tasks, with each worker assigned to at most one task and each task assigned to exactly one worker, such that the total time required to complete all tasks is minimized. The time each worker would take for each task is given in the CSV.
2.  **Identify Model Type:** Based on the query, this is a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) assignment problem (specifically, a generalized assignment problem with worker selection).
3.  **Define Index Sets:** The primary indices are:
    - Workers: Set of 12 workers (identified by their row labels, e.g., Worker 1 to Worker 12).
    - Tasks: Set of 10 tasks (corresponding to columns 'A' through 'J').
4.  **Define Decision Variables:**
    -   `x[w, t]` = 1 if worker w is assigned to task t, 0 otherwise. Type: GRB.BINARY.
    -   `y[w]` = 1 if worker w is selected (assigned to any task), 0 otherwise. Type: GRB.BINARY.
5.  **Identify Parameters (from Schema):**
    -   Assignment cost: The time required for worker w to complete task t, from the CSV columns 'A' through 'J' for each worker row.
    -   Worker and task sets: Worker identifiers from the row labels (excluding header/caption rows), task identifiers from columns 'A' to 'J'.
6.  **Formulate Objective:** Minimize the total working hours, i.e., minimize the sum over all assigned worker-task pairs of (time required for worker w to do task t) × x[w, t].
7.  **Formulate Constraints:**
    -   Constraint 1 (Task Assignment): Each task must be assigned to exactly one worker: For each task t, sum over all workers w of x[w, t] = 1.
    -   Constraint 2 (Worker Assignment): Each selected worker can be assigned to at most one task: For each worker w, sum over all tasks t of x[w, t] ≤ y[w].
    -   Constraint 3 (Worker Selection): Exactly 10 workers are selected: sum over all workers w of y[w] = 10.
    -   Constraint 4 (Worker-Task Linking): x[w, t] ≤ y[w] for all w, t (ensures only selected workers are assigned).
    -   Constraint 5 (Assignment Feasibility): x[w, t] ∈ {0,1}, y[w] ∈ {0,1} for all w, t.
